im a more happier person after discovering the i/p button ! .
but , if you 're looking for my opinion of the apex dvd player , i love it ! .
it practically plays almost everything you give it .
for the price it is a well spent investment ! .
this is by far the nicest one , in so many ways .
it 's very sleek looking with a very good front panel button layout , and it has a great feature set .
its fast-forward and rewind work much more smoothly and consistently than those of other models i 've had .
it plays alternate video formats ( cads , svcds , cods ) very well .
and amazon . com has it for such a great price -- how can you go wrong ? .
what got me to buy was the reviewer that said it would play dvd-rs fill of files ( e . , mp3s ) .
it sure does ! .
that 's a rare and valuable feature .
another nice thing is that the unit has both optical and coax digital audio outputs , though the latter was not mentioned in the literature i 'd scanned before buying .
at double-speed ( 2x forward speed ) , it still plays mp3s with sound -- they are pitch-corrected and smooth , but twice as fast ! .
update : the finish is more " mirror " than silver -- and i like it ! .
player works and looks great - if you can get the dvd 's to play .
for the first few weeks , this player was everything i expected it to be , an affordable multi-format dvd player with a stylish slim case as advertised .
i bought this apex 2600 dvd player for myself at christmas because it got good reviews as a good value for the money on a variety of different sites .
i took it to my father 's house to play a tom jones concert dvd and he loved the player so much i gave it to him .
have used it frequently and have had no problems .
i liked this one enough to buy another .
my dad also has an apex tv and it was another great value for the money .
great quality picture and features .
it looks great - and is loaded with features .
the apex 2600 has been a steady performer for me .
i bought mine in december of 2003 , and have had no real problems with it .
( he had owned two apex dvd players , and was pleased with both of them . )
the fact that this model would play jpeg slide shows was a big plus for me as a visual artist , and i discovered by accident ( it is not mentioned anywhere in the literature ) that it will play mpeg1 files on a regular cd-r data disk without vcd formatting .
while i would like to give it 3 . 5 stars instead of 4 , i gave it a 4 because it has run well for me during the time i have owned it .
nothing has broken on it , and it plays all the dvds i have .
we tried it out christmas night and it worked great .
even viewed cds full of jogs .
well , it was nice while it lasted .
this dvd player plays raw mpeg2 and mpeg1 videos , jpeg , wma , cmdr / cadre / dvd / dvd , and of course plays dvd movies from uk . i love the giff , progressive scan feature .
because of it 's hidden features ( no macro vision , non-regional ) i keep this baby around to watch non-american region dvd 's .
the cool thing about the ad-2600 it plays alot of different file like mp3 , wma cds , jpeg and kodak picture cds , dvd 's , dvd - / + r 's .
it 's not a listed feature but , the one thing that sold the unit is that it plays mpeg video .
i find this to be a great feature .
i 've tried playing all of these discs and they all play great .
for the money apex machines have good features .
it 's low profile , space saving design looks nice .
i find the apex ad-2600 to be a great buy .
i was surprised to find that not only could this dvd player play mpeg2 format which allowed me to stack 2 movies on a dvd , but it also was able to play vb files which i created with smart ripper .
the af feature did a great job converting the letterbox to fill 3/4 of the screen and the image still looked normal .
loved the slim design .
audio is excellent .
i am very pleased with the apex ad2600 . it plays just about anything you put in the drawer .
but , it seems to work so well now , that i do n 't anticipate any problems with it .
simple to use and hook up .
the progressive scan option can be turned off easily by a button on the remote control which is one of the simplest and easiest remote controls i have ever seen or used .
this is the best dvd player i 've purchased .
this player has worked flawlessly for me and at this price , you can 't go wrong .
well , this apex dvd player turned out great ! .
it plays basically every media i 've tested so far , even an old vcd that i ripped years ago and the rental dvd that could n 't be played on my old $ 200 sharp player ! .
i have to say i 'm also pretty impressed by the user interface for playing jpeg , mp3 and mpeg files stored on cd-rs / dvds .
i did not want to have high expectations for this apex player because of the price but it is definitely working out much better than what i would expect from an expensive high-end player .
and the slim form-factor together with the mirror-like front panel sure makes the player look cool and pricey ! .
finally , amazon 's free shipping is really getting good , it took only 3 working days for the player to reach me ! .
for the most part this is a good dvd player .
we are overall pleased with product .
progressive scan player for a relatively low price ( although the better known manufacturers like toshiba , pioneer , and panasonic are now offering lower-priced progressive scan players as well ) .
seems to read most dvds fine , and reads quietly ( i had a pioneer player that had fairly loud disc spin noise ) .
also , i have not had trouble reading svcds that i created and br mp3 cds ( my old apex ad-1200 had trouble with these ) .
output through component connections looks very good , on my non-hd tv .
i checked out the amazon reviews and i 'm pleased to say mine worked , works , fine right out of the box .
i like the auto fit feature = you can stretch wide screen dvd 's to normal .
looks ok - very shiny chrome and mirrors .
this thing plays everything i feed it .
when i 1st tried it i found that it had no problem playing the more expensive dvd - r media disc 's that other players would play but to my surprise was able to play cheep media that i had burned that i could n 't get to work before in anything but the dvd burner itself that i had made the disc with .
easy to use , small form factor , and looks good to boot .
it does n 't smell like burning plastic when you open the drive .
without a doubt the finest looking apex dvd player that i 've seen .
excellent picture quality - on par with my pioneer , panasonic , and jv players .
remote : you can stand it on end ( harder to lose ) , and it 's far better designed than the 1100s .
unlike some of the other people who received a " lemon " , my dvd player came in perfect working condition .
as a whole , the dvd player has a sleek design and works fine .
this player seems to work fine with everything else .
it 's running great for all the dvds i have and rented .
apex ad-2600 runs all the dvd media including dvd + r/rw and dvd-r / rw ( unlike sony or panasonic - one supports only + r/rw and another supports - r/rw ) .
i think , apex is the best dvd player you can get for the price .
most of them are already switched to apex and they are happy .
this has so many capabilities that you 'll always have room for new technologies as they evolve .
i use this with a home theater system and it 's amazing how it sounds , the picture clarity is unmatched ! .
so much packed in a small case and very affordable ! .
it 's a compact , attractive machine and was easy to set up .
basic usage is easy , but the remote has a lot of buttons that i have n 't used .
so far , we 've only used this player a few times to watch movies and it has worked fine .
the picture is clear , bright and sharp and the sound is good .
it works well enough ( so far ) for me to be satisfied with it , and it 's possible that i 'm missing something .
i 'm giving this player cautious recommendation .
there are a lot of things i like about it .
received apex dvd and the picture was great when set up with s connector .
so far the dvd works so i hope it does n 't break down like the reviews i 've read .
amazon was wonderful about picking it up the next day and paying for the return shipping .
retraction : said mine had silver plate : it does have display .
it works great .
the unit seems to play all formats that i have put in it ( jpeg , kodak pic 's and dvd-r ) i have read other reviews and some good and so om not so good , but my feeling at this time is " two thumbs up " ! .
it seems to be working fine , but we 've not used it all that much .
the player looked good right out of the box , offering lots of features and good styling .
amazon is awesome ! .
for the price , it 's a very nice dvd player .
it does play a wide range of formats as advertised which is very nice .
and so far have not had any problems with dvds not being able to play .
i only wanted something to play dvds on but this machine has all these other features that i probably will never use but it 's nice to know that there 're there .
the machine is very light and slim and fits nicely into my tv stand .
i 've had no problems at all so far and i 'm very happy .
besides the one problem , this machine is amazing ! .
it plays everything , even vcd 's .
i will never use all the " whistles and bells " this machine is capable of .
but for what i do use it is perfect .
owner 's manual has substandard troubleshooting guide .
the dvd player is fine .
of course , i was hesitant given the price , but i 've been extremely impressed since receiving it , and bought a second one as a christmas present for my parents .
the picture is perfect , although i 'm not watching on an hdtv .
but , dollar for dollar , this dvd player is probably the best out there .
the player does seem to play dvds adequately enough .
there were a few attractive features , such as the small size and the layout of the remote .
i looked into buying an inexpensive dvd player that had more than the standard set of features and this item seemed to be the best in that category .
i just hooked it up and everything seemed to be going fine .
still , i was willing to overlook those things as this unit looks sleek and has a myriad of features ! .
this is probably one of the few dvd players at $ 40 that can play almost everything you throw at it .
ability to play most discs - i tried dvd , vcd , dvd-r , audio cd and it played all
good looks
this is wonderful to have for your first dvd player .
i brought it for my sister in college and she loves it ! .
apex is the best cheap quality brand for dvd players .
also , very light and portable .
it will read and play all cd audio disc .
i have shopped with amazon before and have been very happy with their performance thus far .
it plays original dvds and cds and plays mp3s and jpegs .
also , it was only $ 39 . 99 ( after rebate ) with free shipping and no tax so overall it is a decent player .
good quality video .
it did play a dvd-r which was unplayable in my older philips machine .
mixed bag i guess but the price was right .
this is the third apex product i 've bought and they continue to impress for the price .
the build quality feels solid , it does n 't shake or whine while playing discs , and the picture and sound is top notch ( both dots and dd5 . 1 sound good ) .
it looks really sleek and stylish , and does everything it claims .
i tried as bunch of different formats to see if it would play and it did .
i am very pleased with this product and the price to match and have n 't had any problems .
there are really easy directions for setup and fiddling around with the picture , zoom etc .
so sit back , relax and brag to all your friends who paid a mountain of money for a dvd player that can 't do half the things this one can , and for a fraction of the price ! .
noiseless , lightweight and oh yeah .
works great ! .
silverfish color really adds a special touch .
it plays just about any format ( check before you buy if it plays yours . )
either way , can 't go wrong with this price .
i am really impressed by this dvd player .
for instance , i made several back-ups of my dvd movies using dvd-r ( w ) and + r ( w ) and it plays the dvds .
no matter the format .
i recently purchased the canon powershot g3 and am extremely satisfied with the purchase .
the camera is very easy to use , in fact on a recent trip this past week i was asked to take a picture of a vacationing elderly group .
they fired away and the picture turned out quite nicely . ( as all of my pictures have thus far ) .
a few of my work constituents owned the g2 and highly recommended the canon for picture quality .
i 'm easily enlarging pictures to 8 1/2 x 11 with no vi sable loss in picture quality and not even using the best possible setting as yet ( super fine ) .
bottom line , well made camera , easy to use , very flexible and powerful features to include the ability to use external flash and lense / filters choices .
i 'd highly recommend this camera for anyone who is looking for excellent quality pictures and a combination of ease of use and the flexibility to get advanced with many options to adjust if you like .
this is my first digital camera , and what a ' toy ' it is ! .
just a little overview , powershot g3 is the flagship of canon 's powershot series and its an slr-like camera , its 4 megapixel and ( almost ) full manual control gives the pictures a touch of brilliance .
whether you are a novice or an expert , its ease of use and functionality goes together .
overall i 'm happy with my toy .
in a word , " awesome " is how i would describe this camera .
i wo n 't go into the details here , as the online sites ( steve's digicams , previews ) go into great depth in their reviews , but i am very pleased with the features , the speed , the picture quality , the flexibility , the automation , and the functional conveniences this camera offers .
with the automatic settings , i really have n 't taken a bad picture yet .
i am absolutely in awe of this camera , canon put enormous quality into the g3 .
i bought my canon g3 about a month ago and i have to say i am very satisfied .
i have taken hundreds of photos with it and i continue to be amazed by their quality .
the g3 is loaded with many useful features , and unlike many smaller digital cameras , it is easy to hold steady when using slower shutter speeds .
despite this minor disappointment , i highly recommend the canon g3 anyone who is serious about digital photography .
i have only had this camera for one full day and i have to say that it is wonderful .
the photo quality is amazing and i know i 'm going to have fun with all the features .
1 ) slr like programming and exposure control gives you latitude to be creative , yet its program and auto exposure settings provide excellent photos if you do n 't want to bother with the settings .
excellent range of metering options as well .
it 's great to switch to spot metering and actually see it working on the lcd screen .
2 ) 4mp is about right for the target market of this camera ( semi-serious amateur photographer )
3 ) 4x zoom is nice
5 ) its focusing system is also very flexible .
you can move the focus range to almost anywhere in the scene with the push of a button , and it has an on-screen manual focus mode that would be really helpful if shooting a scene that is tough to automatically focus .
the camera has a wonderful set of features .
the lcd screen pulls out and rotates in any direction for easy pictures .
the optical zoom works great and the 14x digital zoom is a very nice addition although pictures at the highest digital zoom are a little blurry .
the highest optical zoom pictures are perfect .
i have not yet seen any of the usual problems with digital pictures ( purple fringing , etc ) so i am very pleased .
the canon computer software used to download , sort , upload and manage your digital pictures on the computer is very nice and very easy to use .
the menus are easy to navigate and the buttons are easy to use .
it is a fantastic camera and well worth the price .
recent price drops have made the g3 the best bargain in digital cameras currently available .
advanced photo bugs will find more creative control than imaginable .
newbies will find the full auto setting will give them perfect pictures right out of the box .
4 megapixels is enough for anybody and the photo quality is awesome .
those used to 35mm cameras will find the g3 very comfortable and friendly to use .
the extended zoom range and faster lense put it at the top of it 's class .
i recommend unreservedly the powershot g3 to any potential buyer looking for a first-class digital camera at a reasonable price - there is no better camera out there - period ! .
it gives great pictures , the controls are easy to use , the battery lasts forever on one single charge , the software is very user-friendly and it is beautiful in it chrome casing .
i began taking pics as soon as i got this camera and am amazed at the quality of photos i have took simply by using the auto mode .
this camera has canon 's great calorimetry , plus what you see in the lcd is what you get .
the prints are beautiful ! .
although canon 's batteries are proprietary , they last a really long time , recharge fairly quickly in the camera , plus if you want ' more power ' , you can even find a knockoff charger and spare batteries right here on amazon .
this is a great camera for you ! .
the canon g3 gives tons of control for photo buffs but still has an " auto " mode that makes it very easy for the novice to use .
i love having the option to manually control the f-stop , shutter speed and even focus .
i was able to take great photos of the 4th of july fire works , and got some amazing shots of the kids playing with sparklers .
but if you 've used a slr 35mm camera , the controls are very intuitive ! .
with a quick spin of the dial you can select shutter priority ( for high speed subjects ) , aperture priority ( for focal length ) or full program mode where the camera selects both for ideal photo quality .
the manual mode is easy to use with fast access for the selection of shutter speed and aperture without having to fumble through menu options .
this camera also has a great feel and weight to it .
you feel like you are holding something of substance , not some cheap plastic toy .
the more i work with it , the more i love it ! .
i did n 't think i would find this quality and ease of use for under $ 1500 - i 'm thrilled with my purchase ! .
this is my first digital camera , and i am very pleased with it .
seriously , this thing has everything that a pro or expert amateur could want .
but at the same time , it takes wonderful pictures very easily in " auto " mode , so that even an average joe like me can use it ! .
four megapixels is great .
it is a very amazing product .
i highly recommend it .
just received this camera two days ago and already love the features it has .
takes excellent photos .
night mode is clear as day .
i have not played with all the features yet , but the camera is easy to use once you get used to it .
overall it is the best camera on the market .
a ) the picture quality ( color and sharpness of focusing ) are so great , it completely eliminated my doubt about digital imaging -- - how could one eat rice one grain at a time : - ) )
i love this camera .
took hundreds of pictures and they were great .
great colors , pictures and white balance .
has 4x optical zoom which is higher than any other in the same price range .
when i took outdoor photos with plenty of light and the objects were n 't moving , the photos were awesome .
the camera was a marvel .
it is versatile and seems to be one of the best .
i chose the g3 because of its reputation for very high quality , clean images .
what makes the focus-lock lag time something i can live with is the extreme depth of field obtainable with these point and shoot digicams at f8 .
fortunately , the g3 has a hot shoe that can take an external flash , and fortunately for me , i already owned a one of the highest quality external flashes that money can buy : the met 60 ct-4 .
contrary to what ive read elsewhere , the g3 does sync at 1/250 of a second with third-party flashes , just as it does with the dedicated flashes from canon .
what this plug-in reveals is the truly stunning quality of the raw g3 hardware .
without any tweaking at all , if the exposure is accurate , the colors are as realistic as ive ever seen produced by film , and this is a raw image ! .
but at least you re starting with the most photo realistic images ive ever seen from a camera .
i am stunned and amazed at the quality of the raw images i am getting from this g3 ( in conjunction with my professional flash system ) , and can easily put up with the cameras limitations , because ive never seen anything better within its resolution limits .
i 've had this for 3 months now , and i am pleased with my decision .
this is the perfect camera for a photo hobbiest who wants to have easy point and shoot ability as well .
battery life , the drawback to most digital cameras , to quote k . reeves .
manual functionality is excellent , downloading pictures is quick and a breeze , and the quality is astounding .
the service from the supplier was exceptional .
having used it for more than a month , i can say that it consistently produces topnotch photos .
by cocking the shutter to the halfway position and getting the settings ready to shoot , i was able to produce excellent stop action photos -- contrary to what other reviewers experienced .
the camera is a dream to operate in auto mode , but also gives tremendous flexibility in aperture priority , shutter priority , and manual modes .
i can 't write enough positive things about this great little camera ! .
but canon never fails to amaze .
1 . the ability to selectively switch to raw format during record review gives you incredible more post-processing flexibility .
2 . battery life is over 4 . 5 hours , compared to about 2 . 5 hours for the g2 or the 2 hours for most nikon's .
3 . the remote capture and file viewer software bundled for photo capture is mind-blowing .
4 . the shape of this device is a little squarer , without losing the weight which means better balance and less shaking while clicking .
the light auto-correction is awesome .
you could take a picture of a stone glinting in the sun and still avoid the shining glaze and get the contours right .
8 . perhaps inspired by the canon 's factory white-correction settings ( which were found lacking and had to be altered by a user before the white edges from buildings etc could be cleaned out ) , the g3 has much sharper white offsets .
overall , the g3 delivers what must be considered the best image quality of any current > 4 megapixel digicams , from a detail , tonal balance and color response point of view .
this is quite simply the best you can ask for .
4mp , 4x optical zoom , takes absolutely beautiful photos with detail that challenges all of the above 5mp cameras , easy to understand and use ( has a great swivel lcd screen ) , a lot of features and add-on options , comes with great software ( not to be overlooked ) , and last but by far not least , received my fiance 's stamp of approval ( two thumbs up ! . )
the powershot g3 is a great camera .
because it can help a so-so photographer take spectacular photos ! .
4 megapixels is plenty for all but pros , and you will not be disappointed with the results of this camera .
it 's slightly lighter than the g2 and packed with even more features .
this is my first digital camera and i could n 't be happier .
i love the quality of the pictures .
they look fantastic .
the canon g3 is perhaps the best 4mp camera out there .
with canon , you get pictures that appear to be photos , not still camcorder shots .
i love the es based controls and easy menus .
i bought it for my trip to buns aries , and also used it at the iguassu falls , and could not have asked for more perfect performance ! .
this camera is worth every penny , and i highly recommend it ! .
another point of note : the battery life is incredible ! .
am i ever glad that i decided on this camera ! .
i 've only had it a week , but so far , everything about this camera is making me happy .
very intuitive menus are a big plus on this camera .
the standard battery include with the g3 is a camcorder battery that will allow me to take pictures all day without worrying about charging .
the optical zoom is awesome , and the viewfinder reflects the settings of the zoom .
the best 4 megapixel/4x optical zoom camera available and fairly easy to use .
because this camera is beautiful .
the g3 looks like a work of art ! .
its silver magnesium finish is stunning , and the sharp lines and excellent grip are better than any other camera i 've seen .
i am very pleased with it so far .
it is very simple to import via photo 2 and then move them to photoshop .
i am quite happy with the camera .
it comes with a clearly written manual and the learning curve is not too too steep .
yes , i recommend it over the competition .
best camera ever . from the image quality , color , function , i can say almost everything .
this camera has a cool stitch pictures feature , to find out more just log on to canon 's website .
first and foremost , it will take better pic 's than most film camera 's .
this camera has none of these flaws and will be something you 'll use all the time .
however , for a $ 600 - $ 800 budget , i think this camera is an excellent choice .
it has a beautiful design , lots of features , very easy to use , very configurable and customizable , and the battery duration is amazing ! .
also , the display is " hinged " and it can be placed in a myriad of positions , or to protect it against any damage .
another good thing is that this camera seems to introduce much less noise in dark places than others i 've seen .
i have owned this camera for a short time and would n 't give it up for anything .
it surpasses my greatest expectations in a 4mp camera . .
in general it is easy to use and well laid out .
it makes up for this by being extremely easy to use with well laid out controls that can be learned quickly .
the g3 has most if not all of the features that you would want from a semi-pro / pro slr with a good range of manual options for those who know something about photography .
in the hands of someone who does n 't , it will yield good results on idiot program / auto mode .
the functionality on this camera is mind-blowing .
canon have packed a lot in here and the options and controls are easy to use and logically laid out .
learning how to use it will not take very long .
the image quality is excellent .
range of functions - as indicated above - it has something for everyone : point and shoot power plus advanced functions for those who are serious about photography .
this is by far the finest camera in its price and category i have ever used .
the macro works great for medical photographs and the auto mode is terrific for point and shoot .
this camera is closest to perfect than any other diagram that is 4-5 megapixel .
i 'm glad canon decided to keep the 4mp resolution and improved upon it with new technology ; .
in terms of the shots taken , this camera is insanely great ! .
the pictures are fabulous and their is a ( short ) learning curve to it ; . there are tons of features i have n 't even gotten to .
i 've been pleased with the picture quality and durability in snow , car , boat and wind .
the camera 's a work of art / science -- that 's understood .
it takes great pictures , operates quickly , and feels solid .
everything else about the camera is great .
if you strictly use the lcd and not the view finder , i highly recommend the camera .
and so far , i 've been very pleased .
the larger lens of the g3 gives better picture quality in low light , and the 4-times optical zooms gets you just that much closer .
the moveable lcd screen is great .
the tiny ( postage-stamp sized ) remote unit is wonderful : not only does it trigger the shutter , it can also be used to zoom and review pictures .
the hot shoe flash attachment allowed me to buy and use a sophisticated flash unit :
i needed three batteries to keep myself going with the s330 , but the battery in the g3 is a real powerhouse :
the g3 has a different type of battery charging system from the smaller canon cameras : the battery needs to be charged while in the camera , but the charging system also enables you to use the camera while plugged in without running down the battery .
i have yet to try using all of the adjustment options : shutter priority , aperture priority , light metering adjustments , etc . , but all controls are well thought out and and the manual is relatively clear .
i was worried that 4 megapixel photos would download more slowly , but there 's no difference in working with the files .
i 've now had the camera for two months and i 'm even more pleased with it .
very comfortable camera , easy to use , and the best digital photos you 're going to get at this price .
i 've been using the g3 for about six weeks and it has proven itself to be all that it 's advertised .
all-in-all , i believe this is arguably the best non-slr digital camera on the market .
canon 's optics are better and i believe their processing algorithms are also better .
simply , the canon g3 is the best digital camera out there today at this price point .
the battery life of this camera is twice that of the nikon 5000 and is better than anything else i 've seen .
even with these shortcomings , i still think it is the best digital camera available under $ 1200 .
definitely a great camera .
proven canon built quality and lens .
feels solid in hand .
we really enjoyed shooting with the canon powershot sd500 .
it has an exterior design that combines form and function more elegantly than any point-and-shoot we 've ever tested .
a digic ii-powered image-processing system enables the sd500 to snap a limitless stream of 7-megapixel photos at a respectable clip , its start-up time is tops in its class , and it delivers decent photos when compared to its competition .
the sd500 rivals the canon g6 in image quality .
this camera is truely superb .
the startup time , quality of pictures and videos is outstanding .
they say that they are the best pictures they have ever see from a compact .
i went out and got the canon today .
i 've taken about hundred shot with the canon , in varying lighting situations , all in auto mode , and not one blurry picture ! . ! . ! .
i did not conduct a rigorous test , but just took some identical shots in identical lighting with both cameras , and the canon won hands down .
sharper pictures .
the canon is very small , definitely pocket size , but still easy to hold firmly .
it powers up quickly , so you won 't miss that quick shot .
good image quality .
all i have to say is that the pics i get with my sd500 are both rich and color and high in detail , the user interface is awesome , the battery charger is tiny and super light and sd cards are relatively cheap and getting cheaper all the time .
camera is a paper weight .
i have been very impressed with my purchase of the sd500 i bought it at the beginning of the month as the ultimate pocket camera and have shot 300 images so far with it .
the pictures are tack sharp , colors are vivid , and at 7 mega pixels the quality is plenty high to manipulate and crop images to your hearts desire .
powerup is quick , and you can even set your favorite image to display for a second or so as it turns on .
i have especially enjoyed the 640x480 mode , while not a replacement for a dedicated video camera , its quality easily surpasses that of my old hi-8 camera and is perfect for quick clips of things that still images just dont describe ( max 8 mins at 640 30fps on a one gig card ) .
audio is mono and fairly acceptable , quiet also with little distortions .
the battery life is not that of the casio 's but its good and your going to get better pictures in my opinion with the battery life you've got .
glad to see the ed . revised the previous statements regarding image quality .
my sd500 focuses flawlessly , does not " whine " during video , and my pictures are razor sharp .
this camera is bulletproof .
start up is so quick
you can take pictures seconds after you turn the camera on . . . literally ! .
big lcd screen - at least for me , 2 " is enough
great picture quality - in automatic mode , quality is great .
when you learn how to change some settings , you can make the quality even better
digital zoom is clear too . . . say you used all 3x optical zoom , try to do digital zoom then . . . just try not to shake the camera at all and you 'll still get a clear good quality picture
great video clip quality for a digital camera - so much better than my old one ( canon a60 ( ? . ) . . . the 2 . 0 megapixel one ) .
i connected my camera to the tv and played some video clips and for a digital camera to take such good quality clips , i give it 5/5 stars = ) oh and btw , while you take video clips , you can zoom it too ! . ( digital zoom only though ) . . . but still . . . ( my old one can 't do that . . . you have to zoom it first if you want then take the video clip . )
photo stitch ( merge pictures to create a panoramic one . . even my old one can do this and it 's really cool to have it now still )
turn the camera on while pressing the button ( or is it the menu button ? . i have to check again = ) ) and it 'l show you the time and date .
i highly recommend this camera to anybody looking for a compact camera that can take good quality pictures .
if you 'll only read the whole manual , you 'll find out even more cool features and you 'll learn how to manipulate the quality you want to achieve and all those modes will make sense after reading
it 's such a great camera ! . i think it really was worth the investment = )
if you haven 't noticed , they designed it so that you can also take vertical pictures when you do the self-timer .
they made the other end of the camera flat so you can put the camera upright on a flat surface if you don 't like to take the usual horizontal pictures using the self-timer .
i bought this camera two days ago , and i 'm very pleased to say that it has been worth the money .
if you on the other hand always use automatic settings ( and not manual ) you should be just fine , as the camera features some of the best automatic settings i have ever seen .
all in all , this is the camera for you if you can spare the extra cost in price .
having the digic ii chip helps a lot .
this camera takes amazing pictures and its size can not be beat .
i still can 't believe how fast it starts up .
i take a lot of pictures and this camera is my first choice .
i still have my s70 because i like the wider lens sometimes , but in general , if you are looking for a small camera with the whole package , the sd500 is the only one you should buy .
i love the rounded edges now , fits so much better in a pocket , jeans or suit .
i tell you now , after lot of shooting in many different situations , this camera is amazing .
the size of the camera is perfect .
fits comfortably in my inside jacket pocket or in my pants pocket .
there was no compromise this little camera does amazing things .
i like to take pictures when i go out at night and perhaps some people would complain that noise levels are high at higher iso 's but i don 't really care that much , i think it gives the pictures a certain real-life quality .
the flash is surprisingly good and even the video quality is excellent .
i 'd be happy to talk to anyone about this camera .
this camera is an excellent choice for an ultracompact , take anywhere device and boasts an outstanding movie mode to boot .
the instruction manuals and documentation are excellent so that the learning curve will be much less steep .
i 've only had this camera for a few days , but it 's been great .
the photo quality is amazing .
it 's fast , feels great in your hand and looks great too .
i 've printed several photos and the prints look as good as the screen views .
as any digital camera owner knows is that when you go to take a picture of a moving object to expect some blurring but with some preliminary testing we had simone move there hands back and forth under the lense and another person take the picture and suprisingly a crystal clear image appeared on the decently sized screen .
another thing i like about this camera is the way that you can swap colors around and the impressive video quality i would advise any person in the market for a camera to pay the little extra on the hefty $500 price tag and get a quality camera .
moreover , apart from the plastic cable cover , the camera has a nice , solid feel about it , and it 's so tiny , i take it with me wherever i go .
as it turns out , this is an awesome camera ! .
however , this ultracompact allows the photographer to personalize his or her shooting preferences through a variety of preset and user definable modes .
the sd500 software install was seamless and the product documentation is very detailed .
bottom line , this camera will give you a lot of bang for the buck ! .
i don 't know why cnet says there is a problem with focus , i have all my pictures sharp and high quality .
very good " every day " camera . fits nicely in the pocket of my jeans and takes quality photos .
if you want a sharp looking , fast digital camera and you don 't need or want manual controls , then this is the camera for you ! .
am so glad i bought this camera .
all the good reviews for the sd500 are true .
the view finder shows crystal clear pictures that will look even better when you get them to the computer .
the included software removes any red eye easily .
if you are looking for a small camera to throw in your pocket , take great pics and video , get the sd500 .
this is overall the best point and shoot camera i 've used .
placement of the buttons and software user interface is near perfect .
i also tend to like the sliding cover/on switch found on many compact ps cameras since it 's much faster and easier to power on if you need to take that instant shot .
overall build quality , good macros-results , impressive video-quality , good pictures with flash ( good colours , sharp results ) , excellent auto white balance .
could be better to be a perfect camera ( and some competitors do some of this better ) : purple fringing , details in high-light area , noise over iso100 , red-eyes , ( few ) processing artefact's , ( few ) loss of some details especially of the hairs of peoples in low light , automatic autofocus , whizzing while video-playback , better video compression ( smaller viedo-files ) , more manual controls , longer lasting battery , indicator for battery , better protection of the lcd , less weight .
when the overall image quality ( especially natural colours , details , natural looking of the pictures ) is the most important thing , then this camera its top notch and very impressive .
in low light with flash i found it clear better then the sony p200 ( too much red , colours overall not as natural but fewer red-eyes ) .
i found best results in most situation with manual/center auto focus , manual mode , iso 100 ( shorter aperture-time , so more often sharper images as with iso 50 ) , auto white balance ( auto white balance is better than of the other canon cameras i have and they already do very-well ) .
i upgraded from a very small 3 . 2 max camera to this camera with great results .
good color and very little needed to correct photos on paint shop pro .
neat feature for self-timer allows you to record two different warnings .
the manual is excellent .
also , multiple picture feature is very , very fast .
very fast powerup and great speed when taking multiple pictures .
perfect size ! . beats the competition by leaps and bounds .
i am impressed with this camera inside and out .
i love the camera .
this camera is perfect for the person who wants a compact camera that produces excellent photos in just about any situation .
the camera res ponce is very quick .
i have a canon a 70 , and now this sd500 , its amazing , how this little camera produces , such great pics , it even brings out ur pimples on the face .
and the video quality is amazing .
and it fits right in my pocket much easier than my old s30 .
i want to start off saying that this camera is small for a reason .
i 'm in high school , and this camera is perfect for what i use it for , carrying it around in my pocket so i can take pictures whenever i want to , of my friends and of funny things that happen .
i 'd say that this camera is perfect .
ok , not quite everything . . . but this camera is so compact that you will have it by your side when you need it .
i bought this camera for the same reason many of you are considering it , or have already bought it -- it 's size .
it is amazingly small , it 's hard to believe all that has been packed into this camera .
it is so small that i am able to keep it in my pocket , and i don 't have to fear that it will get ruined in my pocket because it is so durable .
there is also a small covering for the lens , so you need not worry that the lens will get scratched .
the picture quality surprised me , when i first saw this camera i saw how small it was an instantly assumed that the picture quality would not be good -- but i was wrong ! .
the picture quality of this camera is outstanding ( taking its ' size and price into consideration ) .
the focus is great , though , if you are not taking a macro shot .
i have come across many other beginner cameras that i prefer over this camera , but the thing you have to keep in mind about this camera is the size .
if you are just looking for something to keep with you at all times , then this is a great camera choice .
after considering my needs further and researching the marketplace , i decided on the s100 .
it has given me zero problems , and the more i use it , the better i become at taking advantage of its strengths .
this wonderfully small digital camera produces fantastically good pictures printed on any decent photo-quality printer ( with photo quality paper ) .
it will not replace your high-end 35mm slr but it 's a great toy to keep near you at all times for snapshots .
this is the best camera you can have for digital images if you want to :
take quick pictures with excelent resolution
hate to wait between shots
download it fast to your computer
have a great and easy to use bundled software
travel with it without knowing you have it in your pocket
fyi , battery doesn 't die if you don 't use lcd
the color and light i captured with this camera on a 12-day trip to turkey ( gorgeous vividly colored ceramic tiles inside darkened mosques ) were far superior to anything i 've ever gotten with a traditional 35-mm film camera .
i love this camera .
i don 't believe this camera is still available . but if you can find one , you might like to get it .
it 's still one of the smallest 2mp digital cameras on the market , and absolutely one of the best-built most stylish cameras ever .
i am very pleased with my purchase .
i 've been incredibly happy with this camera .
this camera is great if you 're used to a high-end slr .
it 's overkill for simple snapshots , unless you 've got way too much money to blow .
exposure compensation in 1/3 stop increments ( i leave it set on +1/3 stop to brighten up the default exposure , which goes a bit dark for my taste ) .
slow-syncro flash , macro/infinity mode , etc .
the ss body is wonderful , feels high-quality .
it 's the same body as the popular elp2 aps camera ( take a look at a standard credit card from your wallet and you 'll have an idea of the front profile ! . ) .
i discovered that the camera has a manual mode that gives you total control over exposure , white balance , flash ( red eye , person against bright background , flash on , flash off , flash automatic ) .
it fits in your pocket .
the panorama setting is unbelievable ! .
you have the option to have the flash automatic or off .
the new canon s300 is 33% larger and 26% heavier than the s100 .
it has one more resolution of 1024x768 and a " normal " compression mode . and , it has the 3x zoom .
but it takes gorgeous pictures for a 2 . 1 mp camera .
i love this camera ! .
i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon .
i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .
i got this camera for an unbelievably low price at amazon .
i would recommend this camera unequivocally ! .
but this does work even if you turn off the lcd viewing -- great battery saver .
a great camera , but here are some points which i don 't notice in most of the reviews here , which may be of concern especially to the more advanced amatuer :
i purchased the elph s100 mainly because i thought it was cool .
the camera does a great job with exposure and prints made with my professional printer looks great ( not as good as prints from my pro digital camera , but still very good ) .
but i was ready to upgrade and when i discovered that canon was going to come out with an even smaller digital camera with a higher resolution , i had to have the s100 .
this is my second digital camera , but i 'm much more impressed with the canon s100 digital elph than i ever was with my kodak dc240 .
this camera is so light and tiny that i literally carry it everywhere with me , which is great considering i 'm an artist and like to capture interesting items for future painting .
the software that comes with the digital elph is very nice and intuitive .
the photostitch software is very cool if you want to do any 360 degree panorama shots .
other than that , i love this camera .
the pictures are uniformly excellent and color rendering is perfect .
the good : small size ; . durable-seeming metal case ; . easy to use ; . visually distinctive ; . good picture quality ; . fast usb connection ; . mostly intuitive operation ; . really cool photostitch software that knits pictures together to give wide panoramas .
if compact size is your highest priority in a 2-megapixel camera , the canon powershot s100 digital elph is a standout choice and aptly named for its diminutive design .
the s100 's image quality rates in the middle of its class , but it can still be a reasonable choice for students , families , or small businesses looking for an ultra-portable camera that weighs less than half a pound with media and battery pack .
i purchased this camera before it went on sale , and while i wouldn 't have minded keeping the extra $$$ , it was definitely worth it .
i have been absolutely , completely satisfied with the product and its capabilities .
this is a great product , and canon has done an excellent job .
i received this little jewel as a gift and i can honestly say absolutely love it .
i give this product five stars for its usability , performance , expandability , and definitely looks ! .
first , i have to say that i have never had the slightest problem with this camera or the software .
the software has been installed on windows 95 , 98 , 2000 and xp and i haven 't had any problems with it .
the camera is solid , performs well , takes good pictures , and the battery lasts pretty long if you disable the lcd viewfinder .
they are razor sharp , the color balance is perfect , and the focus is great .
i must say , i think this is the coolest camera i 've ever owned ! .
first , it really is tiny ; . the size of a pack of cigarettes , maybe a scotch deeper .
second , it is incredibly easy to use .
i just went on a quick photo shoot in nyc 's central park today , and what a bunch of beautiful photos i took , if i do say so myself ( and i do ! . )
the camera is as easy to use as a point and shoot , and with instant review on the lcd screen , you can retake any flubbed shots on the spot .
the two-times optical zoom operates smoothly and quietly , and lo and behold , a two-piece shutter-like cap automatically slides closed over the lens when you turn the camera off .
i also had no problems installing or running the camera software on my pc .
at any rate , if you have been interested in digital photography but the price and confusion have held you back , consider the canon s100 digital elph .
it really is the perfect travel camera , plus it offers the convenience of digital photography .
really like it , easy to use , great images , very intuitive , fits in my jacket pocket .
i was looking for a compact , rugged ( i carry it hiking , skiing , boating , etc ) camera which is easy to use .
i wanted standard memory expansion ( cf cards ) , macro mode , and if possible , a waterproof housing ( for kayaking ) .
even with the waterproof housing it is small .
the lens retracts and has its own metal cover so you don 't need to fuss with a lens cap .
the metal housing seems very rugged .
the macro mode works well , although it takes some practice since the camera doesn 't clearly indicate when it can 't focus .
the white-led backlit lcd is very bright and crisp , even in sunlight , and relatively easy on the battery .
the panorama modes are wonderful .
it 's so small and light , even with a spare battery , you really can take it anywhere .
in auto mode anyone can use it as a point and shoot camera .
the manual modes give you a lot of control over exposure and white balance ( but there is no manual focus or manual exposure ) .
there are better cameras but none anywhere near as light and compact .
1- small .
very small .
i 've had a lot of cameras , but this one is actually being used , and not stored in a desk : it 's all ways in my shiest pocket .
2- excellent picture quality and so simple to use ! . ! . ! .
4- looks great .
silver metal case -not plastic .
5- excelent software package .
6- small but very clear tft screen .
don 't care about sunlight : it 's tft .
7- 360 panoramic pictures are a very big deal .
i researched and researched between getting the canon s20 or the canon s100 , and of course i got the latter ! .
i was looking for something that wasn 't too complicated to use and to help the pics i post on ebay show more detail .
this camera is great , wonderfully small , and has attractive hi-tech casing .
very easy to use for someone like me who 's just hopping on the digital camera bandwagon .
the controls are easy to understand and big enough that they are easy to see and use .
the optical and digital zooms combine to give an effective 4x zoom .
this is enough capacity and capability to do a complete household inventory , for example .
so , why the small digital elph , rather than one of the other cameras with better resolution or picture quality ? . size[+2]
after getting one for christmas from amazon , i 'm now a believer : the digital elph is truly the world 's smallest digital camera that shoots great pictures .
i 've had this camera just over 2 years and it takes pretty good pictures .
the size is tiny , which i love .
this camera is so easy to use ! .
all the features are incredibly intuitive , even for a novice like me .
the pictures are beautiful , and the camera is so small you can carry it anywhere .
i , as many others , have waited for many years for the convergence of price , features , size and ease of use to hit that happy center point .
i bought this little guy a few weeks back , and i have to say that i never had so much fun with a new toy as this .
you indefinitely appreciate the small size .
while , there are flaws with the machine , the xtra gets five stars because of its affordability .
it is the most bang-for-the-buck out there .
like it 's predecessor , the quickly revised nx , this player boasts a decent size and weight , a relatively-intuitive navigational system that categorizes based on id3 tags , and excellent sound ( widely known to be better than ipod - not surprising considering the number of years creative has been in the audio peripheral business ) .
the xtra improves upon the zen nx with a larger , now-blue backlit screen , which is infinitely better .
i chose this one because from what i read , it was the best deal for the money .
another reason i got it is because you can put wma files on it .
the software is great .
transfering is easy , the software makes everything pretty easy .
even the battery life is great - it advertises 14 hours , it 's actually a little less but still good .
they player 's interface itself is also very easy to use .
get it , it 's woth every penny ! . ! .
i 've had it for a week now , do n 't regret the purchase one bit , and i never leave home without it .
software is easy to use ( although red hat software is better , but costs money )
much cheaper than i-pod good looking player ( beautiful blue back-lit screen ) if you 've read about the player , some have complained about the lack of a viewing hole for the face when the case is on , but this is good because the face does n 't get damaged / scratched fast transfer rate
the zen xtra sounds great with good headphone and well re cored mp3s .
at 8 ounces it is pretty light but not as light as the ipod .
the battery is replaceable ( a real plus ) and there is a leather case ( another real plus ) .
so far the software for the pc works easily .
by the way , it looks nice also .
it 's worth it .
my two main requirements were longer battery life and lower price : i found both .
the controls are on the side instead of on the front , which i like , because that 's where my thumb is when i hold the thing ! .
the scroll wheel is a big improvement over the ipod touchpad .
the included leather pouch is a big plus : it actually protects the unit well , something a lot of ' carrying cases ' fail to do with other audio devices .
other plusses : changeable battery , loads of presets for environments , decent construction , still quite small and light despite being slightly bigger than an ipod .
overall : small , sounds great , and less expensive than apple 's overpriced ipod ! .
( batteries last longer too ! . )
the creative labs zen xtra has all the features the i-pod has and if you get if from amazon your only going to pay $ 300 for this great player .
i 've had it for about 2 weeks and it 's the best player i 've seen , and used , ever .
the music is easy to get to ( all of the menus are easy to understand despite what alot of i-pod owners say ) and if you know how to search for an artist by name online , then you can do the same with the zen .
the screen is very easy to read and the blue light is bright enough to read at night , but dim enough so it does n 't blind you when you stare too long .
all in all this a great player that blows the i-pod away , with easy to use and understand features , software that is simple to understand and use , and a great sound ( which is all that matters in a mp3 player ) .
it 's a very intuitive program .
i had no problems following their installation instructions .
the menus are very easy to navigate .
the other controls are all very easy to use .
it has several play options , one of the best is an option to shuffle , based on all or a certain playlist .
it also costs a lot less than the ipod .
the earbuds that come with it are n 't that bad .
they 're pretty comfortable , stay in place and deliver a decent audio quality .
this is a good deal for music and data storage .
on the positive side , the sound of the player is pretty good , once you have everything configured .
i have n 't had time to really push this player to the limit , but audio aspects on the nomad are satisfactory , as should be expected from creative labs .
when it came down to it , the price on this player is hard to beat .
other than that this thing is great . . .
zennx 's replaceable battery was the deciding factor in my purchase of zennx over ipod .
the zennx will keep running for the price of a replacement battery , just like any other battery-powered appliance .
i love my new nomad , its great ! .
for some this might be a problem , but for the price of a 30 gig ipod , you can get a 60gb nomad , the ipod simply pales in comparison .
the software is very easy to use , and within 30 minutes of opening my box , i was out and about listening to any one of my 80 cds .
the free ( i didnt know they still did that ) carrying case is really protective , and to me its the only accessory you need ( except good headphones ) .
but if you want a great deal and a great mp3 player , get the nomad .
best electronic i 've bought since i was born .
so easy to set up , had some problems with my archos .
just easily drag and drop files into the nomad explorer and from there you easily alter id tags and sort your music according to your liking , by artist , song title , genre , etc .
not only is it functional and runs super smooth & fast , but it is also eye candy .
very sleek & stylish as well as the screen options and visuals it has .
the leather case it comes with is pretty nice , similar to a pda style case and does hold and protect it perfectly .
all the buttons & necessary lil ' gadgets are on the sides of the player which is nice for when you are holding it in the palm of your hand .
the sound quality is also nice . . . after i hooked up my sony headphones instead of those factory earbuds it comes with .
lots of sound options , has an equalizer almost like winamp with the options .
navigation is so smooth and finding files is a cinch .
also navigating while playing music is a plus unlike my previous player .
oh , and the screen saver feature is pretty sweet ^ _ ^
another plus in my book , no file limits ! .
i have over 2000 files in my playlist at the moment and the random does a nice job mixing it up .
i am quite happy having over 10 gigs of music stored on this baby as well as a few gigs of media files in the data folder .
i really have no complaints over this unit .
i really do recommend this to anyone in need of a new player .
i have no complaints with this mp3 player .
getting files onto it is quick and painless .
then sorting the files is easy as pie .
and it holds so much music and audio files .
my music demands are pretty intense and this handles those demands without problems .
the battery is nice .
the lcd screen was very large and readable .
compared to everything else in this category , this is most definately the best bang for the buck .
i gave the zen 5 stars because it 's excellent for the class that it is in and it 's not really appropriate to rate it based on players in a different class .
sound quality was the same between the two , but the zen did have more sound adjustments with the normal eax features .
i love this player .
i love this player and would probably go with creative labs again .
the software was great , as long as you have an administrative user account ( windows xp ) .
anyway , this player is a great deal and i really love it .
way less expensive than the ipod .
i find it pretty easy to use . . . and unlike the remote interface for the audigy 2 nx ( on the pc ) . . .
not counting the time i spent editing the songs ( i suppose i should 've done it anyway on my pc ) the transfer was pretty painless .
bought the 30gb xtra a couple of weeks ago , and so far it has been excellent .
i still have over 19gb left , and already have over 200 cd 's on it .
both are very easy to learn & use , and intuitive enough for even a novice .
ripping & transferring tunes is basic , and pretty fast ( even on a 1 . 1 usb ) .
people also have complained about the case not having a window , but that 's not really a big deal to me either -- the case is sturdy and offers very good protection .
it 's easy enough to pop it open to see what song you 're listening to .
the sound quality is excellent ( and i 'm fussy with that stuff ) , the unit looks cool , screen is bright and easy to read , and the replaceable battery means a major advantage over the ipod ( besides the price , but everyone knows that ) .
you of course have some good customization options with the unit as well ( sound presets , navigating options , playlists , etc ) .
all other buttons are pretty sensitive to touch and work well .
but i 've already emailed creative tech support about it , and gotten timely responses - they will fix it for me if necessary . . .
it still fits in the palm of your hand , and it 's not heavy .
bottom line . . . great product , unbeatable price .
i just received my 40gb zen xtra yesterday and i 'm extremely pleased with it .
the setup and transfer process was cake for me .
now that i have all my music on it there has n 't been any more problems .
the screen is large and bright and has all the info i need where i need it .
the eax mode that keeps the volume at the same level for any song will come in handy when i take my holiday plane rides .
all in all though i 'm very happy with my new mp3 player .
i purchased the nomad jukebox zen xtra 40gb and it is fantastic ! .
i found using the supplied mediasource software very easy .
ripping your songs and creating playlists could n 't be any easier .
i found using mediasource to load your songs to the nomad jukebox to be much easier and faster than using windows explorer .
being a creative product the playback quality is unbeatable .
when i played back a symphony orchestra you would swear that you were seated dead center in front of the orchestra - it 's that good ! .
the sound quality with jazz and pop music is equally superior .
actually using the nomad jukebox is easy and uncomplicated .
finding a particular song ( s ) or album on the nomad jukebox is fast and easy .
the high resolution screen is easy to read and has a backlight .
i can highly recommend this product because of its ease of use ( hardware and software ) , playback quality and value for the price .
just bought one & i 've enjoyed it to date .
nice palm sized unit , somewhat bigger then the ipod but not an issue if you 're not going to try & jog with it or something .
all reviews i 've seen seem to indicate that the creative mp3 jukeboxes have the best sound quality of these 2nd generation jukebox ed ( ipod , archos , dell , samsung ) .
the eax settings are somewhat superfluous but not really a negative .
- great value 40gb vs 10 gb ipod for the price
- best in class sound
- large easy readable screen
working for 10 hours with it on " shuffle " totally rocks ! . ! .
i love it ! . ! .
i had no problems setting up the software and getting my favorite cd 's transferred .
transfers are surprisingly quick through usb 2 . 0 .
it is great sounding , even with the supplied earbuds .
i must have differing preferences than others here , as i prefer the supplied earbuds to the sony 's that i thought sounded good on other players .
i love the storage in this thing .
despite the things that i have listed so far , i could live with this item since it saves me from lugging a cd case to work , to the gym , in the car , etc . .
this is my second creative labs mp3 player , and it is definitely a fine product .
first of all the player 's sound quality is superior to the ipod .
the player 's software is very easy to use and very good .
compared to musicmatch , the software has a better filing system and easier to use .
to keep it short , this is cheaper , and in my opinion a better choice than an ipod .
this thing seriously is a good player though .
overall i like the unit .
1 ) price / gb of storage
2 ) storage capacity
3 ) user replaceable battery
overall i like it .
the storage capacity is great .
the price compared to the ipod is great .
price , along with the replaceable battery ( which i understand apple charges a small fortune to replace - as well as the hassle of returning it ) were the two main factors on why i picked the nomad .
i 've had no problems with the software .
i found it intuitive to use ( i did n 't read any documentation for it and was using it successfully within a few minutes ) .
this is a nice feature ( i . e . it 's early in the morning and you rather listen to " easy listening " rather than " heavy metal " - no problem .
the software comes with plenty of defaults genres .
the sound from the player is ok .
this thing is great , i like to use it to pick up tough stains on my counter top and also to listen to my old 8-track records .
one good thing , it is 40 gb of disk space ( well , it is 38 gb in reality ) .
for the price and features it is really good .
the 30gb zen xtra rocks my socks , spills my beer , but does n 't wash my car .
longer battery life , greater accessibility to online music services , and pc compatibility are the sensibilities .
i just purchased this player and i have to say that i love it .
the sound is excellent , the battery life is excellent , the fact that the battery is replacable is excellent , and finally the price , $ 200 cheaper than the 40gb ipod , is excellent .
the nomad is not ugly , it is not that big , it comfortably fits in my pocket , or heavy , and the controls are not hard to get used to .
so far i have no complaints and i recommend this to anyone who wants quality over appearance , also anyone who wants a hard drive based mp3 player and wants to pay next to nothing .
i just bought this player today and i already love it .
otherwise , this player is awesome ! .
it has a clear blue light that allows you to see everything on the screen easily .
the volume range is great , so you can blast it if you want .
overall , this player is awesome and i definately recommend it .
i received this item for christmas and it has met and exceeded all my standards .
naturally i did quite a bit of review before purchasing ( i recommend www . no madness . net ) , and price-wise zens are unbeatable .
compared to other leading dd mp3 players , the value per gb is the tops .
- sound quality : excellent , everything you would expect from this company .
- the unit is easy to use and intuitive .
- uploading music is quick and easy .
although the supplied software can be annoying at times , on whole it is excellent .
- the unit itself its well structured , with just the buttons you need and none you do n 't .
as often mentioned , the scroll tab is average , however , not difficult to use or horrible .
the screen is large , defined , and easy to read , and the silver unit is naturally cool .
there are lots of interesting features included such as eax , and customization .
- the replacable battery is great since once it eventually wears out ( as all lithium batteries do ) , you will be able to buy another easily .
also , the nomad 's 14 hours of battery life versus 8 is handy .
- equipment included is average , but that is n 't a big deal since thats not what you are buying it for .
the headphone earbuds are average , so just use your regular pair instead .
this player is an ideal purchase .
i have no problem using the player itself and i feel it is a very good player .
i have the software working fine now and the mp3 player is fantastic .
so once i worked out the problem with the software this mp3 player is worth the money it cost .
i 'm very pleased with my zx so here 's a quick review .
it is small overall , bigger than the ipod , but keep in mind that this is because different , less expensive but not necessarily inferior technology is used in the zx .
the zx boasts superior sound quality than the ipod , however it compromises a bit of the unit 's size in doing so .
the lcd is larger than the previous model , the nx , and has a bright blue backlight which illuminates the screen more successfully than the nx 's green backlight did .
the scroll wheel is easy to use and works great for me , however many have complained that the wheel is cumbersome and difficult to operate .
the sound is excellent as one would suspect from a creative product .
the included eax support is useful at times , especially when you listen to a variety of genres , as it will adjust the equalizer for you which can be a big hassle .
the signal to noise ratio ( the ratio of detectable , useful data to unusable garbage in , say , a radio wave ; . a larger stn ratio is better ) is nice and high at 98 decibels , and it should be noted that apple refuses to release the stn ratio of any of the ipods .
the software has n 't been a hassle for me at all .
lastly , the price is fantastic :
i uploaded the drivers and new software in 15 minutes - no crashes or problems .
usb 2 . 0 - very fast
but the sound is very good ( and loud ) and works well on my portable speakers .
and for those that are int rested the recharger works anywhere in the world ( and is quite small ) .
it looks very cool , and seems quite small to me and very light .
the scroll button seems ok , i have no problems with it .
i am very pleased so far .
very simple to use .
all in all suprisingly easy to use .
lots of flaws , but exceptional sound quality , hd size , and price make it a good buy .
excellent sound - i found the music reproduced faithfully through the jukebox .
transfer through windows explorer - windows recognizes the jukebox as an additional hard disk , so it allows you to simply drag and drop files from windows explorer to a folder for the nomad .
i found it very useful for transferring large files to another computer .
huge storage space - even at 320kbs , you can store a ton of songs on this thing .
having usb 2 . 0 makes for very fast transfers .
i use it for ripping cds , which it does a pretty good job of .
overall , i feel that it 's a decent buy , and am happy that i own it .
for the price and size and features , you can 't beat the price .
the buttons and interface are very easy to use .
simple click buttons , back buttons volume and display are very easy to read , access and use .
with this mp3 player you get much more memory for much less than an ipod .
i have found that the interface on the nomad is very easy to use if you have a basic knowledge of a computer .
i have had no problem what-so-ever with this product .
the software installed flawlessly and without any problems on my windows 2k machine .
the battery life seems good , takes very little time to charge , it uploads mp3s quickly and there is no delay between songs .
took me a few tries to get use to the navigation , but it 's a very user friendly player imo .
i have n 't messed with the firmware at all , the player worked perfect for me right out of the box .
all-in-all , this is another excellent creative product .
it 's small , light and nice looking and the display is decent as well .
i would recommend this product to anyone .
before asking for the zen xtra specifically for christmas i researched many different mp3 players but finally decided on this one , and now that i have it i could n 't be happier and i 'm convinced it 's the best one out there .
many people have written about the software being its one downfall , personally i have n 't had a single problem with the software , i 'm running windows me .
the cd ripping to mp3 is so easy , and you can even rip the cd directly to the mp3 player , so it wo n 't take up space on your pc hard drive .
the software runs smooth , it 's nice to look at , it 's very organized , easy to follow and makes things very simple .
the controls on the player are very simple , no need for a manual .
the player is fast and sounds great , it also has many options like slowing or speeding up the music , or making it sound like you 're hearing the music in a huge auditorium .
the battery lasts very long when playing music , but writing files to the player drains the battery fast , so you need to have it plugged into an outlet when sending files .
playlists can be made on the fly , without aid of a computer , and you can use play modes like shuffle and repeat for your ' now playing ' selections or playlists .
the software could n 't be better and the mp3 player works like a dream , i could n 't give this anything but a 5 , i wish there was a 6 .
it is an extremely cool cozmo .
well i have to say that this product is very good i mean it might be a little big but it still fits in your pocket .
well surely this is a product that i recommend someone in getting rather than any other mp3 player ( at that size and the price ) .
not only is it more affordable , but its a better player for windows , which is what i have .
it hasn't gone below the second notch ( i charge mine whenever i 'm at home and not using it ) , so the battery life seems fine ( so far ) .
oh . . . and file transfers are fast & easy .
it 's easy .
the buttons are easy to use , and its easy to navigate .
the big backlight makes things easy to see , and the writing is big enough for people to see .
my favorite thing about the nomad is the eax feature .
its really cool .
sound quality is amazing . i was expecting worse , but its really good ( especially if your files have good sound quality ) .
you can also slow a song down & speed it up , which is cool too .
also , you can store data on it , which is a plus . for all you people who want to buy an ipod just to say you have an ipod , do n 't bother , this is a much better buy .
first i 'll start off by saying that this players hardware is pretty good . . .
while the ease of use was very impressive , i was put off by the price -- about $ 130 more than what i paid amazon for this player .
i have had the nomad jukebox for about three weeks now , and i am very happy with it .
the storage capacity is great for me --
the bottom line for me is that i am very happy with this product .
a lot of people complain about the creative software , but i actually find creative mediasource organizer to have some strengths over itunes .
first , the zen lets you sync to more than one computer .
the zen is an outstanding way to shuttle music between sources , you can 't do this on the ipod ( except for a cumbersome work-around using the ipod as a hard drive instead of a player ) .
second , the " automatic " sync on creative lets you review the songs before it begins its transfer .
the zen serves as a back-up device as well as a player .
third , creative software allows you to keep two windows open to look at both the content on the player and the computer .
for those of us that like to tinker , i think creative offers some advantages .
zen allows you to scroll up and down the song list selected on the player .
it also lets you remove songs from the play order .
if you bring up an album , but absolutely hate some of the tracks , the zen will allow you to delete that from the playing order .
its ability to serve as a back-up for my music collection is a huge plus .
i got this thing for christmas and i have been very happy with it ever since .
the software is quick & easy to use & i found the entire process very easily mastered .
the unit works great with my cassette adapter for my car & is also easily worked without taking your eyes off the road ! .
overall it is a great unit & hopefully creative labs or some other vendor will soon come out with some accessories for it .
this did n 't bother me too much because it 's still a decent size .
it comes with a good case that fits it snugly .
extremely convenient .
great price .
i thought the software was decent enough - it was n 't complicated to learn at all .
i 'm really happy with this purchase .
now he res the stuff you should know starting with the good things : the screen is really big and the blue light in the back is perfect , fast as hell in music transfer , controls are easy to use after mastering the scroll button , great sound and ive heard many mp3 players , a ton of different equalizer type deals on here .
but it comes with a tank of a case and if you cut a piece out where the screen is you can always keep it in the case and still access everything .
ive seen em all , the archos , dell , ipods , everything . . . good price and great sound makes this one the best in my opinion .
* price and capacity
* slick-looking design and improved interface
* removable battery
despite its being slightly larger than the ipod , i must say i was surprised to see how small it was when i unwrapped the box ! .
i am ripping my cd collection into 160 kbps wma files ; . this gives an average of around 60-65 mb per cd , good for about 900 cds in the ~ 57 , 000 mb of free memory available to me .
file transfers are fast , nearly a song per second via usb 2 . 0 .
to my ears , a 160 kbps wma file sounds just as good as the source cd , and the zen xtra sounds just as good as a portable cd player .
the eax features are pretty cool , as well , as creative has included a number of eq adjustments that , for example , compensate for the extraneous noise encountered in a car or on a train .
at the end of the day , what i wanted was a large-capacity player which allows me to easily play any album from my collection wherever i go , and the zen xtra 's combination of price , capacity and features easily meets those criteria .
i got this for christmas , and it is a great gift .
i have been ripping songs into it for the past few weeks , and the ease of use is wonderful .
the memory will hold an amazing amount of songs , my entire collection of cd 's will all fit on this great little tiny piece of digital fun .
plusses are the easy to remove battery and the terrific sound produced by the nomad .
ripping the songs , even with my 1 . 1 usb connection is still very quick , and the quality is very good .
considering the price and specs , this might be the best buy out there for a large memory mp3 player .
it 's really a shame , because otherwise , creative mp3 players are very good , and have the best sound quality of any players on the market .
after some consideration i chose the 40gb nomad zen xtra from creative , and i have not been disappointed .
first , the battery is replacable by the user , because creative intended it to be - unlike apple with the ipod .
it was easy enough to remove the front plate , and there was only one way the battery could be inserted .
the new organizer software that ships with the nomad zen xtra could n 't be easier to use .
you can create playlists , drag & drop songs and playlists to your player , and rip directly from cd to your player .
and with usb 2 . 0 , transferring music to your player is incredibly easy .
the sound is great , and the volume is more than satisfactory for commutes and shutting out external noise .
i thought i 'd have to buy a set of headphones to use with it , but the included earbuds work quite well .
they could be more comfortable , but no complaints in the sound department .
i 've played around with the equalizer settings and am satisfied at the range of choices i have there too .
1 . i achieved my basic objective ; . my entire cd collection is on a portable device with lots of room to store more .
the zen has minimal stoppage between tracks ; . when listening to music that continues from one track to the next the gap is just a hesitation - a slightly audible click ; . if i am not listening for the progress from one track to the next i do n 't even notice the click .
m3u files are used by most mp3 players like musicmatch and winamp , but not creative - without notmad you need to manually recreate your playlists ) ; . it does n 't care what software you use to rip or catalog your music - creative or any other company - all my 12 . 5 gb of music were transferred to the zen with correct tags - hooray ! .
given that i already have the zen the only reason i am happy with it is because of the notmad software .
now that i own it , however , i can 't imagine being without it ! .
i have stored around 60 cd 's ( at 160kbps ) on this and have barely touched the available memory .
the sound quality is fantastic ( cd quality ) and it is really great to carry this around instead of stacks of cd 's or tapes ! .
it is exceedingly simple to navigate around in this device .
i did n 't read a thing about how to operate it -- it was just intuitive .
one other plus is that napster now supports this device via their software .
+ the memory ( 40 gb ) is staggering .
+ i had no problem using musicmatch software already on my computer to load songs and albums onto this unit
+ screen was good , easy to read
+ / - sound quality was good but it was going to take some tweaking with settings to try to make it great .
i decided to save the $ $ and opted for the zen xtra . . . and i was not disappointed .
the player is intuitive and outputs great sound quality .
navigation is easy and i found that syncing files from the player to the computer ( and vice verse ) was easy too .
many have complained about the software included but in my opinion it 's easy to use and effective .
i love this player and am extremely happy with my decision .
the price / performance looked just right .
i did buy the notmad software a week ago and found that a vast improvement .
1 ) great sound ( > 98db signal-to-noise ratio beats ipod 's " unspecified " ratio ) and good power output allow the zen xtra to drive large head-phones as well as external speakers .
with my sennheiser 497 headphones , the volume is loud enough at 12 ( max is 20 ) .
the player works well with my sony srs-a 202 powered speakers .
2 ) the player user interface ( ui ) is intuitive to use , and allows easy navigation of a large or small collection .
3 ) the nomad explorer ( winxp style interface ) works well to transfer files back and forth to use the nomad as an external although the tech support web-site states that the primary intended purpose of the player is as a player .
the nomad explorer provide most of the functionality offered by 3rd party programs like notmad .
4 ) usb 2 . 0 means fast data transfers ( 1 song / sec ! . ) .
5 ) the cheap , user-replaceable battery ( $ 50 from creative ) is a great advantage over the ipod 's battery which costs $ 100 to replace .
6 ) excellent battery life - 14 hours beats ipod 's .
7 ) chic look and good build - the player comes in a compact form with a metal face plate .
i use it primarily in the provided protective case although i have dropped it about 3 feet from my desk ( by accident ) as well as have played it outdoors in - 30 fahrenheit weather ( by design ) and it has continued to work fine .
8 ) creative mediasource , although not as sleek looking as windows media player , is effective in organizing your collection and is linked to a good cb service ( gracenotes ) .
i do n 't always care for gracenotes ' genre listings but it allows easy editing of id3 tags .
b . fast mediasource cd ripping - takes about 40 seconds for a cd on my pentium 4 pc ( 2 . 4 hz with 1gb ram ) with 52x drive .
c . i do love audio sync which allows a one-click synchronization between the player and the music collection on the computer .
9 ) wake-up feature that allows you to set up the player to wake up and play selected music at a specified time .
10 ) multiple play modes - tracks in order of album , shuffle , etc . , is standard on all jukebox players but worth noting that the zen xtra is not deficient in this matter .
11 ) minimal pause between songs - less than that on other devices - good achievement for a hard-drive based player
12 ) big storage - my entire cd collection in one small device ( 5717 songs , 491 albums and counting ) ! .
7 ) some people have problems with the flip switch on the bottom that releases the player cover - has not been an issue for me and is immaterial if you use the case as the case covers the switch .
great sound ; . good interface ; . replaceable , powerful battery ; . good software ; . wake-up , sleep timers ; . multiple play modes
can 't beat carrying 500-cd collection with me wherever i go .
also love waking up to music with attached speakers .
i felt better with this one since it had the shuffle feature and i 'm not too keen on www . ipod's dirty secret . com .
replacement battery is $ 50 compared to ipod 's $ 150 .
i loved this product when i first got it - great sound , easy to use ( even though i agree that the software was n 't the best ) and held enough songs to suit any mood .
the combination of the price , storage size , and player features makes this player the best on the market .
fact is , it could n 't be easier to use .
sound quality on this is amazing , as with all creative products .
even leaving it on the default setting ( without the eax enhancements ) produces crystal clear playback .
the menu allows you to search for files by artist , genre , and album quite easily .
the battery stays charged for a long time , and takes no more than 2 or 3 hours at most to fully recharge via the included ac adapter .
connect the player to your computer ( via usb ) , open up mediasource , and you can listen to your stored mp3s as they stream directly from the xtra ! .
usb 2 . 0 transfer is insanely fast .
my first impression was positive .
overall , a good buy for the price .
easy enough to navigate through , although i 'd prefer a sturdier button besides the thumb wheel scroll / push button .
pros : huge storage capacity for the price , easy to navigate , can modify existing playlists on the fly , has a removable battery
reviews for sound quality are generally ( but not universally ) positive .
sure , this thing is definitely more cost-effective than an ipod .
our special friends at creative gave this thing good sound quality , great features , long battery life , and an unbeatable price .
i bought the player this week and i like it by far .
removable and cheap battery - a li battery usually works properly for 1-3 years .
value : comparing data storage with price .
the appearance is okay ed ( at least not ugly ) .
the size is small ( just a little bit bigger than an i-pod . )
easy to use : a lot of reviews has mentioned about this
the display is awesome , you can see everything you want and read it clearly
huge storage space , i loaded my entire collection of music , which isnt that much , 400 songs , and still have 26 gb , out of the 28 provided to you .
the sound is awesome , but if u put it too loud , depends on your sound quality , the sound might crack .
with eax on , you can modify your sound , with 4 different presets , which is pretty good , you can get different variations with it .
if you use software correctly , put in all the id3 tags , you will get an awesome database collection , from which you can easily access your songs .
i dont know what other people are saying , but the software is awesome .
battery recharge , is an awesome thing , because it recharges in only like 2-3 hours .
when you turn on your player , the player turns on really fast , and the music continues to play , as you left it when you were turning it off .
you can manage your profile , change the contrast of backlight , make different type of display , either list or tabbed .
you can do other different things with it such as choose what kind of " now playing " interface , you can see the interface as modern or classical .
there is an alarm , i still havent used it yet , but it should be good .
there is a clock , and date , which can get helpful .
the player has firmware , which will remove the glitches , if there are any .
the music plays awesome , never skips , even if u run for a bit , so you can listen to music without interruption .
and also , it 's priced very afford ably .
with 40gb of storage i have about 7 , 500 songs on the player ( everything music file i have is on there ) with room for about 2 , 500 more .
the software interface supplied was very easy to use but i went ahead and got red chair 's " notmad " software because of some advanced features i wanted .
sound settings can be adjusted for personal preference .
accessing files by artist and album ( i mostly look things up by artist ) is easy and intuitive .
possibly the biggest advantage this player has ( if price was n 't enough ) is the fact that the user can replace the battery him / herself by opening the lid and popping in the new battery .
since batteries do run out on everything , this will also be a big money-saver since ipods , rivers , rca , dell , all have built-in batteries that need to be replaced by a technician ( apple charges 100 bones for the battery replacement ) .
try before you buy if at all possible : although i am a mac addict now for over a decade and everyone i know has previously bought an ipod , the nomad zen xtra was a far better value and is just as easy to use with regards to both hardware and software interface .
i like the nomad 's color better , but it 's not terribly flashy .
i have had mine for a month now and have to say i have enjoyed it .
price ! .
sound quality is wonderful , i really like the smart volume sound normalization .
i quickly got to use to the interface and can find any song / playlist etc fast enough .
i also liked the fact that you can save custom playlist you made on the player not just the computer ! .
have had the player since xmas's and love it ! .
great sound , very long battery life ( i routinely play it for 12 + hours ) , very fast recharges rate , removable battery , storage size , nice screen , firmware updates , and great price .
this is an excellent player , especially for the price , with features that are comparable to and even excel the ipod .
for a price that 's still less than even the lowest level ipod i was able to get this 40gb monster , and the best part is it works as great as it was advertised to and then some .
the system is terrific in size and design , imo looking better than the ipods .
it 's very solidly built , and has a nice dense feel to it .
i find all of the controls well-placed and not flimsy in the least .
the scroll wheel is better than the ipod 's as well , in that you do n 't risk giving yourself a cramp running your thumb around in circles endlessly - just a small nudge of the finger and you 're there .
the screen 's large and easily read .
sound : exceptional , though i can 't really compare it to the ipod .
interface - practically seamless .
yet after ensuring that all the id3 tags are in order ( with the software which is actually not as bad as people make it out ) it actually turns out to be really handy .
playlists can be generated on the fly ( which is a bit clunky but still a really nice bonus ) or by using the software , and there are a bevy of eq options .
as i mentioned before , the creative mediasource software is actually really robust despite what others have said , though notmad may still work better .
it 's easy to transfer , preview , and organize files .
the in-program id3 tag editing is a strong point , as well .
it was no problem for me to use their software .
overall , i 'm giving this 5 stars as i 've seen nothing of the problems people have repeatedly cried havoc over , but as i 've only had the player for a while i leave room for doubt if the headphone jack , hissing , or scroll wheel problems show up with me too .
please consider this much superior piece of equipment before plopping down half a grand for an ipod .
honestly , i love this player .
because other people that complain about this player are talking bull , this player is awesome , it just breaks fast , which is horrible .
the sound quality is very good .
having access to so much music where ever you go is terrific .
works great , no odor , and uses regular bags .
so far ( 3 weeks ) , we 've had no problems with the diaper champ at all .
it contains the smell from our baby 's diapers and we can use just about any kind of bag inside .
i don 't know if we 'll run into trouble down the road with odors , but so far i have no complaints and i 'm very happy not to have to buy those refills .
the diaper champ is the best we found ! .
there are no spec ail bags to deal with or buy ! .
we use the cheap $1 . 99 13 gallon vanilla scented bags from the grocery store but you can use any bag you have laying around .
we empty ours every day and we have never had an odors from it ! .
it is far better than just a trash can or the diaper genie and it 's fairly inexpensive as baby products go ! .
i love that you don 't have to purchase expensive refills .
if i had to do it over again , even with the cost savings of using any type of bag , i would go w/ the diaper genie .
it 's far better than all others on the market .
it 's easier and much more convenient to use because it doesn 't have clumsy and confusing ( not to mention expensive ) refills .
there is no odor and extremely easy to use .
1 . it uses regular garbage bags instead of brand refills .
3 . it never smelled - at all .
the container is hard to open , which is exactly what you want when your baby becomes a toddler , and you do have to flip the handle carefully ( which has saved more than a few of her toys , too . ) i don 't consider these difficulties but features for the older baby .
this is a must have product for all new moms ! .
this is easy to work and easy to dispose of the dirty diapers .
it is much easier to fill and unload than the diaper genie , plus , why buy refills when you can use trash bags from the dollar store ? .
it also holds a lot more diapers .
look at the size of it ! .
i highly recommend this ! .
i have to say that i am very happy with it so far .
i am happy with the fact that i can use any bag in there and dont ' have to pay out the nose for replacements .
it 's also so easy to use and holds a great deal of diapers .
the bags attach inside the champ easily and all one has to do is cram the diaper down and flip the handle .
i bought this diaper pail when my son was just a few days old and i absolutely love it ! .
the diaper champ couldn 't be easier to use .
and the biggest plus is that you don 't have to buy any expensive refills .
and it does an excellent job of keeping the odor contained , which the diaper genie never did ! .
if you are looking for a user-friendly diaper pail that actually does keep the odor contained , than the diaper champ is the one for you ! .
this item is exceptional i like the ease of use and it held the odor in great .
diaper champ is by far the best diaper pail ! .
it holds a lot of diapers , not to mention the odor ! .
it 's easy to use ( just a flip of the lid , and the diaper is gone ! . ) .
it 's also easy to empty out .
and best of all , no wasting money on special refill bags -- -this takes ordinary garbage bags ! .
whether you are using disposable or cloth diapers , this is the truly the only diaper pail to get ! .
even though i never ventured into the cloth land , i was very impressed by how well this works at keeping diapers and their accompanying odor in the pail and out of our life ! .
being a very economical person , i appreciate the fact that any plastic bag can be used with this system- i never did like the prospect of buying special diaper genie refills .
but from my experience , by the time it gets to that point , the bag is really heavy , so i think this is kind of helpful- it 's a built-in way of keeping the bag manageable upon emptying .
this is a really great buy , for yourself or as a shower gift .
go for the champ .
i love this product ! .
with the enormous numbers of diapers that you go through with a newborn , it was great how easy it was to dispose of the dirty ones .
plus , the fact that it used regular trash bags is great .
no need to pay for the special refills that the other brands require ! .
and we still love it ! .
*holds a lot of diapers -- a full week of toddler diapers ! .
( we wrap them nice and tight ) *we use our regular kitchen trash bags -- cheap ! .
*holds the odor in nicely ! .
( every now and then i spray down the inside of the pail with lysol ) *easy one-hand use *impossible for my inquisitive child to get the dirty diapers out of the pail every now and then odors do escape the pail , but that is rare -- and it usually just means that we 've crammed too much in there and need to change the bag .
we keep the diaper champ in our daughter 's nursery and her room definitely does not smell like dirty diapers .
it holds quite a few diapers , and pops them in quickly and easily .
i use the same store-brand tall kitchen trash bags i already use in the kitchen for it -- no special " diaper " trash bags necessary .
it works with a minimum of fuss .
the diaper champ turns the smelly diaper into " what diaper smell " in less time than that .
this is one of the best purchases we made .
great product , easy to use , economical , effective , absolutly fabulous .
update i knew that i loved the champ , and using the diaper genie at a friend 's house really reinforced that ! .
there is no comparison , the champ is easy and smell free , the genie was difficult to use one handed ( which is absolutly vital if you have a little one on a changing pad ) and there was a def finite odor emanating from the genie plus we found that the quick tie garbage bags where the ties are integrated into the bag work really well because there isn 't any added bulk around the sealing edge of the champ .
i love this pail ! .
no smell , easy to use with one hand free , and best of all it uses regular tall kitchen garbage bags so you don 't get suckered in to using only the bags made for the pail that are impossible to find ! .
i think it 's great .
it definitely keeps the smell out .
first 4 months it was in our bedroom and we did not even smell any odor .
the diaper champ is the best ! .
i have tried other pails , but none have compared positively to the champ .
1 ) the champ is easy to use .
with the champ all you had to do was drop the dirty diaper into the opening and flip the lid .
it was so easy my toddler would dispose of her on diapers .
2 ) the champ uses regular store bags .
you do not have to waste money or time trying to purchase special bags for the champ .
3 ) the champ is odor free for at least 15 months .
the champ did not start letting a little odor through until well over a year .
regardless to this fact , i believe the champ is the best way to go .
let the champ win you over ! .
no need for deodorizers .
i use the regular kitchen trash bags and it is so easy to empty .
even did while daughter sleep and no noise ! .
i use the scented bags and even if i don 't no smell ! .
this holds alot and does not take up alot of space .
but like i stated , its better then a trash can , but i 'm not sure if its better then the diaper genie .
it holds almost a week 's worth of diapers , and you don 't need expensive refills - any kitchen bags work .
at first i had a problem with some smell , then i realized if you flip the lid back and always keep the same side facing in - then there is no smell at all ! .
personally , i am very pleased with the diaper champ .
it is mindless to operate .
it doesn 't stink , ever ( like some have assumed since it doesn 't wrap each diaper into its own neat little cocoon ) .
and it is very easy to clean .
i can keep one hand on my baby and dump the diaper at the same time , it is that simple .
this is a great diaper pail .
there is no odor and it is very easy to use .
( you can do it one handed while still hanging on to the baby . ) also , we like using regular trash bags instead of having to worry about buying refills ( like with the diaper genie ) .
and it 's the largest diaper pail i 've seen without taking up more floor space .
and we definitely prefer our champ ! .
not only is it much more cost effective ( you can use regular trash bags rather than refills at $5 a pop ) , it is easier to use and clean , and has a larger capacity .
i got the diaper champ because of the great reviews as well as the fact that you can use regular garbage bags .
it works great .
i can 't smell anything ( and believe me , this is quite something with my baby ) .
i ended up buying one for upstairs and one for downstairs because it works so well and because i change him so often downstairs .
we have been using our diaper champ for almost 14 months now and we are very happy with it .
it sits in the corner of our bathroom and we have never had any problems with odors at all ( and we live in the damp and humid south , where odors of all kinds are generally rife ) .
it is easy to install and change the ordinary trash bags , easy to clean , and most important , easy to use one handed - just insert folded dirty diaper and flip the handle .
we have never had any problems with anything like loose wipes getting stuck ( we always wrap them in the dirty diaper ) .
it is a bit difficult to get the unit open ( the advice to take it slowly is sound ) , but now that our son is walking and exploring , i consider this a positive attribute ! .
update ( march 2005 ) : my son has been out of diapers for almost 2 years now , but the diaper champ hung in there till the very end - easy to use , no problems with odors , and one of the best bargains among all of the paraphernalia required for the modern baby : - )
i decided to go with the diaper champ rather than the more popular diaper genie , because i didn 't like the idea of having to buy special bags .
this product is a lifesaver ! . ! .
i have never had an odor problem ! .
no one has ever come to my house and noticed 'diaper odor . '
in fact , people who have been present while i changed my almost 3 month old son 's diaper have been amazed at how the very 'potent ' smell of the dirty diaper seems to disappear once i dispose of the diaper in the diaper champ .
simple and it works ! .
all in all , this product is definitely one i would recommend and certainly worth the very reasonable price .
i love the diaper champ , it is really easy to use and since you can use regular garbage bags it doesn 't cost an arm and a leg for refills .
using your own bags is much cheaper and convenient .
the height is a more convenient reach than others , where you have to hunch over .
its stable , so a curious toddler can 't easily tip it over .
i wanted this product because i didn 't have to buy special bags for it and it also came highly recommended .
this is a great product ! .
the champ works great .
we use regular kitchen sized garbage bags .
we 've never experienced odor from the pail .
it was easy to assemble , and the diapers fit perfectly into the little nook before they make their way into the pail portion .
i also love that you can flip the device with one hand . . .
excellent diaper disposal unit .
i am so pleased with this product ! . ! . ! .
a wise investment for the pocketbook & for the nose ! . ! . ! .
diaper champ is great .
so i can 't tell you if diaper champ will be as good at containing the formula generated poop smell , but it 's excellent at containing the smell of poop of my breastfed baby ! .
friends told me that the diaper genie did not work very well , so bought the diaper champ based on on-line reviews and i have been happy with it .
it works easily with one hand , which is important .
also , it takes any kitchen sized trash bag , so there is no special bag to stock .
while the perfect odor free diaper pail has yet to be invented , the diaper champ is a good as it gets .
i was using the cheaper pail . . . and it worked ok until the opening device fell apart .
i could probably use a trash can and be ok at this point , but this pr duct seems to work very well so far .
this one is really great .
i actually took a friends word on it and went with this champ when registering and i am glad i did .
well the champ has survived it 's first year with our son and it is great ! . ! .
the thought of not having to buy refills and just using regular bags is awesome ! .
we just buy the smaller bags that come like 250 to a roll and are scented and they are like $6 . 00 and they work great .
we just recently had to buy another roll of bags . so $6 . 00 for a year of bags- can 't beat that ! . ! .
we lysol the champ every time we change the bag out and have not had any problems .
this is really a nice diaper pail .
i recommend it to both parents of infants and toddlers .
in fact , i liked it so much after using it with my son who is now 2 years old , that i bought one for our new baby 's room .
wow - was that disappointing and we didn 't even have it 6 months before it broke .
i bought the diaper champ and have been very happy for the following reasons .
1 . the diaper champ doesn 't require special refills that are expensive and hard to find ! .
we just use the glad tall kitchen trash can bags with odor shield from target and they work wonderfully .
we don 't have to worry about running out of refills with this diaper pail ! .
2 . it can be operated with one hand - leaving a hand on your baby on the changing table .
so much safer than the others that require a two handed operation ! .
the diaper champ is so simple that my toddler loves to put his own diapers in the diaper champ and flip over the handle .
3 . bags are easy to change .
works great ! . ! . ! . ! .
5 . the price is right .
i purchased this router at a woodworking show after watching the ct people using it to demo their bits and was impressed how it performed .
from the internet , woodworking books , local stores and personal opinions the hitachi m12v 3-1/4 hp router time and time again came up to be the router of choice or best for its price .
but i wanted to do some raised panel work and needed more power and variable speed to run the large-diameter bits .
the hitachi has plenty of power , runs smooth , and cuts effortlessly through maple ( with freud bits ! . )
since i use it in a table , i don 't use the plunge feature , but if i ever need it i 've got it .
the hitachi is made in malaya , and looked cheap compared with the makita , which is made in the usa .
but it is smooth , it is powerful , it is affordable & it has a proven track record .
so for the money it costs for one of those top-of-the-line models i 've got a good router & a nice table to put it in & i like that .
hitachi 's m12v is a big beast of a router .
in my table the m12v has been a real champ .
the heavy motor and continuously variable speed control let this router churn through everything i threw at it .
nice things about the m12v : - in a table , the powerful 3 1/4 hp motor is great - soft start helps a lot to control the beast when you turn the router on - continuously variable speed control - amazon 's price
this is truly a clydesdale among the industry 3hp+ router workhorses .
built like a tank , yet nimble enough to be comfortably used with the leigh dovetail jig .
the soft start is a tremendous help for this type of operation .
the edge guide is top quality , easy to install and accurate .
this was possible due to the variable speed settings for any sized bit .
the height adjustment knob is a bit flimsy , but it works well and provides good accuracy .
this is a great deal , and i 'm elated with my decision to go with hitachi 's green machine .
wish i could give it 4 1/2 stars .
i noticed that the micro adjustment knob and collet are well made and work well too .
the speed control is well designed and it works perfectly .
the included fence guide is easy to set up and quite accurate as well .
the plunge lock and power switch are very easily accessible which is a must when doing free hand routing .
it is heavy enough to make it stable , but not too heavy to preclude hand use .
overall this tool is very well worth the price and i have no regrets about my purchase .
this is an excellent router for the money .
other than that , i think it is the best router for the money .
i must have gotten a good one .
i don 't have problems with the depth adjustment , the speed control , the collet ( i haven 't tried the 1/4 " sleeve yet ) .
i would put the hitachi up with the best ! .
no vibration ! .
smooth plunging ! . ( it did stick a bit so i sprayed it w/ lubricant .
it is a great router for a table and with the depth adjustment knob it is easy to adjust depth precisely .
it is very easy to change bits without removing the router from the table and the shaft lock works great .
very good balance in the hands and lighter than most 3 1/4 hp models .
the soft start is nice .
the price is incredible with the bonus pack and hitachi 's $25 incentive ( you need the code -- -go to tool seeker . com and it tells you )
the total price with delivery ( free shipping ) was $135 ! .
less than a cheap cordless drill or a laminate trimmer .
saw the hitachi on amazon . com with their $25 . 00 coupon ( at the time ) and could not resist trying it out .
unlike other reviewers , i like the tool because it is easy to operate outside of the router table .
both the on/off switch ( soft start ) and the depth lock are within easy reach of the right hand .
it is no more heavy than any other powerful router and not as bad as some porter cable models i tried .
for me , it is as important that the tool be comfortable to use as it is that it produce a high-quality result .
can recommend the hitachi in this ergonomic arena -- at the price quoted on amazon it is a bargain .
after getting used to the m12 all the rest seemed lacking .
on top of being a workhorse and ultra reliable , it is just a plunge router that works really well .
i use it in the table ( never take the springs out - just attach the fine adjustment knob ) , in my woo drat and freehand and it works great in all circumstances .
what an upgrade ! . ! . ! .
i have only used it with the 1/4 " collet and a 1/2 " round over bit , but i love how it starts up with little torque and runs very quietly .
the depth adjustment and bit changing is much easier on the m12v than it was on my old router .
the handles make it very comfortable to use and i experience little vibration .
combine this with the excellent price we got in the gold box , and i 'm really happy .
i 'm sure i don 't use it to the degree of some of the other purchasers , but i really like it ! .
i first used the router in the free hand mode and liked it a lot .
i find it very stable and comfortable to use , it doesn 't jump around or make me feel like i need to use a lot of arm strength to keep it under control , and it has very good visibility to see your cut .
it came with a good fence that is simple yet precise and thats well made and won 't break .
also i like the position of all the controls and the fact that it doesn 't have any extra knobs or gizmo's .
i prefer things that are simple .
the router has plenty of power for any type of bit or wood i need to cut , and the speed control knob is easy to get to .
its not a perfect system but its a very good one .
i 've owned this router for over 8 years and am somewhat satisfied with it .
it is quiet and has plenty of power .
i find that it is stable in my hands and its ' weight actually contributes to that stability .
i love the performance and features of this router .
for the money , i 'm not sure you can do better .
it 's very quiet for a universal motor-driven tool , and the height adjustment stick and variable speed control are great .
smooth plunging mechanism .
the guide fence for freehand routing is well made and solid .
even with that , i highly recommend this router - outstanding performer .
i purchased two of these beauties .
i have a tendency to do quite a bit of research before i drop money on a tool and everyone i talked to loved this router .
one cabinet shop has been using one regularly in a router table for 11 years without a problem .
the design of the col lets is excellent and far exceeds any of the craft man ( toy/junk ) routers i have previously purchased .
they were easy to setup with plenty of power to hog through anything i have encountered .
