i have noted that as you use the tool , sawdust builds in the channel and it requires attention .
not a killer problem , but not well done , either .
the only beef that i have with it is that there is a little too much slop in the columns when the lock is not engaged .
if it weren 't so big i would probably by another since no shop is complete without a handful of routers . .
i did have to cut off the ears that hold the template guide in place so i could get those big panel raising bits in it .
i also removed the springs in the plunge tubes to make it easier to raise .
i added a crank for those times when i need to make fine adjustments , but i seldom use it .
i also put a bend in the wrench so i can remove and install bits from the top of the table .
that said , i am disappointed in the plunging mechanism .
shortly after i brought it , the plunging shafts started sticking .
after repeal cleaning and re cleaning , it still stuck after using it for a little while .
i no longer use it as a plunge router , only as a stationary or table mounted router .
if the plunging action is critical to your work , look elsewhere .
it 's oftentimes hard to get a good grip on the router , activate the chuck lock , and get enough muscle behind the wrench to get the collet loosened up .
i was some what sceptically when i seen the price deference between the other makers of comparable hp .
this router was a huge disappointment .
the depth adjustment was sloppy .
the speed control is recessed too far in the housing and required a tool ( screwdriver or dowel rod ) to effect any speed change .
it was impossible to change the speed with just my fingers .
my son tried it and he too couldn 't change the speed without an assist .
i sent it back , as i think that the speed control is either poorly designed or defective .
all in all , not very good .
the only not-so-positive comment i have is about the depth adjustment , it is not easy to micro-adjust accurately .
the major reasons i didn 't give it a five are : one , i didn 't think the fine adjustment worked well .
i replaced it with a router raiser and it works much better .
two , the single wrench just doesn 't work well .
the sliding latch is does not stay in place .
the fine adjustment knob which came with the router was very difficult to use on a router table .
finally , i gave up and i purchased a router racier .
i am seriously considering purchasing another wrench and just not using the " sliding wrench " which comes on the router .
it it is a bit heavy for hand held work , but any router this size will be .
recently the variable speed control went out .
it would work fine for a while then as the motor warmed up it would die .
the only other problem with this router that i have encountered is the plunge action will start to stick , then it needs to be cleaned and lubricated .
only problem is that is a bit heavy .
they last about 1 1/2 years until the problems start .
my first router is a safety hazard if you do not pay attention and are not very careful .
luckily the soft start helped before it took the wood and tossed it or worse case , a finger .
once a depth is locked , it will jump off a little while working .
you must keep double checking depths .
well , my second one is now beginning to hi cup a bit after about 1 1/2 years .
the electronic speed control is not doing it 's job and the router begins to speed up and slow down at will .
if this machine just stops on you , unplug it quickly and get out of the way ! .
the wizard is particularly sinister .
it just tells you to start disconnecting and attaching cables without any input as to whether your current setup includes a pre-existing router ( mine does ) , without any clarity as to whether you should be running the wizard on a hard-wired pc or a wireless equipped pc .
the box proudly displays " securest ( tm ) " " wireless made simple " " one touch setup button " " easy start " " easy security " " easy everyday " apparently linksys/cisco knows that ease of setup is crucial .
however , configuration of my system and actual setup of the router for wireless use took me more than 3 hours , and briefly made me reconsider my choice to for ego the airport and its notoriously easy setup .
too bad they don 't mention anything about how the cd can 't be used with a mac .
i even downloaded the product 's user manual - useless .
the linksys technical support site has nothing about configuring the router for use with a mac .
i say adequate because it was enough to get wireless working , but nowhere near enough instruction to do the proper configuration job that i could have done if so ! .
what this product really needs is better documentation for how to set up the router for different operating systems ! .
* i 'm giving it 4 stars because the setup process was so miserable .
i had some issues when i had enabled wep encryption and then moved on to wpa .
linksys is more costlier than others and is a home/consumer division of disco .
there were no other obvious setup instructions - though there was a soft copy manual , it did not give an answer readily on what do to .
the only other problem was that security for the wireless connection .
little to no networking experience , just in case the automatic cd method has issues .
this is not an enterprise piece of hardware that you will find in an office or corporate environment .
the new hardware version does not run linux at all and most likely will not since the memory has been cut in half .
i tried the cd setup program without any luck .
essentially , the cd included with the package is , for the most part , worthless .
however , this product performed well below my expectation .
the achilles heel of this router is its inability to stream music , or copy large files over the local network .
after some research on the net , i discovered that there is indeed a flaw with the current wrt54g design ( wrt54g , version 3 , which amazon currently sells ) .
it is not reliable .
a couple of times a week it seems to cease access to the internet .
that is , you can not access the internet at all .
very annoying .
the installation software cd crashed repeatedly .
i then tried to set up the router through linksys 's browser interface , but as the only instructions available tell you to use the installation cd , i had little luck - i did manage to connect briefly , but the connection kept dropping , and with no idea of how to resolve that issue , i gave up .
i couldn 't get the install wizard to work .
knocked 1 star off for the install wizard - it wasted alot of time running it .
it took me three days , to the tune of neil young 's song " piece of cr -- ! . " , to get this to work with the satellite hookup i was hired to connect this wireless network up to .
there is not a word about satellite issues in either the user guide or the " knowledge " database at linksys . com , and first tech support person i spoke with kept me on the phone for an hour , then gave me a web site address to consult -- that turned out to be the one i 'd already found during a search of my own .
i was having intermittent problems with it losing connection .
i 'd recommend this is you want to wireless network your laptop , but if you want to wirelessly network a couple desktops together you might want to wait until linksys improves their desktop software/hardware .
unfortunately , linksys does not write the best documentation .
i tried to do this by instinct and it 's not intuitive unless you are a network geek .
i had a lot of problems setting it up , since the software given along with it is buggy .
the firmware has bugs too , so download and install the latest firmware from linksys .
the instant setup button in the front of the router messes up the network it is better to configure the router manually .
this is not a router i would suggest for a novice user , my old dlink di52 ! .
the internet connection would go down every 5 mins when i used it with a p2p program called bit spirit .
so-so 1 . customer service - 6 calls half were efficient other half were equally incompetent .

both of them keep disconnecting on me and interruptions are 3 or 4 times per day at best .
stay away from this junk .
was a bit wary because the software is windows only and i have an mac .
the downside being that the tito can only connect at 802 . 11b speeds and not 802 . 11g .
( . . . ) like most soho routers , it has nearly non-existant logging .
now this router is not the cheapest on the market .
even the pdf manual that comes with it is pretty vague for someone not familiar with " mac settings " , etc .
we bought this about 6 months ago and it 's been worthless .
it constantly drops the internet connection and simple things like walls in our house block the link so everything is very slow .
the tech support is worthless too .
unfortunately , creative offered scant few pages of instruction , which meant that i was on own from the outset .
after attempting to navigate the clumsy touch-pad system , i could not get the unit to download my wma files .
so , you might inquire , why don 't they make it a first priority to carefully , simply explain how download music from your music library to their device ? . ? . ? . this seems academic to me .
most of us just want to plug and play , not spend a year navigating a maze of complicated options . . . like transfering everything on a hard drive to this stupid thing .
unfortunately , the touch-pad issues [non-intuitive] and poor instruction guide killed it .
this one is particularly bothersome : allegedly one can use the zen micro as a portable drive to store and transport data from one computer to another .
who wants to go through the hassles of loading software onto a " foreign " computer just to move over some simple ( * . txt ) files ? .
) button sensitivity : even reduced to the lowest sensitivity setting , the buttons are far two sensitive , really takes some getting use to , and even then , it is still too sensitive .
) worst feature possible , this alone makes it rate one star : what 's up with no recharge cord ? .
you have to purchase that separately for some outrageous cost .
i took my zen micro with me over the weekend , and was forced to lug my laptop with me on the trip for one reason : to keep the zen micro charged .
i have trashed this product on other opinion sites based on this major flaw alone .
) creative , inc . the maker includes the barest of the bare minimum in the box , then through gross profiteering nickles and dimes you on every single accessory at extraordinarily inflated prices .
the box included a little polyester , pull-string bag , ( yes , you read right a bag , something a boy would carry ten marbles in ) and tries to pass it off as the case .
if you want to purchase a real case or container or clip-on carrier for you zen micro , expect to purchase it separately and to dish out big time . .
iriver has a better fm receiver built in , but the drawback to iriver products is they are flimsy and poorly constructed .
as i wrote , this could have been a great product , but expect hidden charges ( read gross profiteering and price gouging ) as the company royally sticks you on every conceivable accessory necessary for normal daily usage .
the touchpad is annoying sometimes ( give me the click-wheel and pres sable buttons any day ) , but not at all as difficult to get over as other people are saying .
and supply those stupid white headphones .
the touch pad does take a little getting used to .
the touch controls took a little getting used to but now i wouldn 't change it for the scroll wheel .
software the software that comes along with it is not very intuitive but once you are used to it , it does the job well .
there are 2 things that need fixing first is the battery life . it will run for 6 hrs without problems with medium usage of the buttons .
second might be a problem i might have with my pc but not too sure , when the player is connected on the usb and i start playing on it and also using the windows explorer , it sometimes pauses by itself and tries to synchronize with the pc during play , which is a bit irritating .
however after just one month my headphone jack was broken as a result of normal , every-day use .
i dont especially like how music files are unstructured ; . basically they are just dumped into one folder with no organization , like you might have in windows explorer folders and sub folders .
the headphones are not very comfortable , but most people have a certain style they like so just go buy new ones or keep the ones you have .
the creative mediasource software that comes with the zen micro is cluttered , and excludes my favorite feature in itunes , the ability to automatically copy everything you import into a certain folder .
negatives of the player itself : you need to do a little work before having full enjoyment of this player .
even on the low sensitive level , a slight touch can skip or pause the track .
this fixes some glitches such as the player freezing .
first thing i noticed was that the creative wasn 't well made .
one drop from a pocket or desktop , and it 'd be a goner .
problems with the sound quality were evident right away , but even i couldn 't imagine they 'd be that bad .
the eq is awful , and even at top volumes , the bass is flat sounding .
cranking the master volume level up past the mark of the bar only leads to distortion and compromised sound quality .
the headphone jack gave out after only a couple weeks of use , and the stock earbuds were replaced same day with some high end sony 's i 'd been having .
if you 've been listening to cd 's in your car for awhile , dealing with the drop-off in sound quality may take some getting used to .
even after all the nightmare sound problems , i 'd still half-way like this product if it kept it 's promise ; . the ability to store 1500 songs .
i got about 700 loaded up before it told me i was full , and at that point , i was ready to toss it out the window .
my friend has an ipod , and although the sound quality probably won 't meet most audiophile standards , the product itself is better than anything creative has made .
the only reason for not giving it 5 stars : the claimed battery life of 12 hours is very optimistic - possible maybe if you really sit down and listen continuously for 12 hours without ever touching the player , but in real life i can probably get 6-8 hours at most .
even the " shorter " battery life , though , has not impaired my positive experience with the zen micro in any way .
limitations : - not a lot of original accessories like the ipod .
- the battery life leaves a lot to be desired .
i downloaded the new firmware which was supposed to take care of the problem , but it hasn 't worked .
- the outlook syn ch only works for non recurring appointments , which personally is very annoying to me but probably wont be to most people . -
i occasionally flip songs while working out as i accidently hit the pad even lightly ( yes i have it in maximum desensitized mode ) .
- not compatible with audible . com books .
overall , it does its basic function very well , but we expect more from the mp3 players today and the zen micro does not rise to the occasion .
pc software that comes with the player is not as simple as i tunes but its not bad at all .
the scroll bar again takes some getting used to .
since zen does not have an external antenna it has some problems catching weak signals but it works .
i dont use the belt clip cz it fails to hold the player securely ( design problem ) .
what i dont like : nothing much except headphones , belt clip design .
p . s . the only snag i encountered while initially configuring the device was trying to hook up the micro to a front usb port . the bus for the front port on my motherboard did not have enough power ; . after connecting it to the rear ports , it works perfectly .
the ipod mini is smaller and sexier , albeit limited in supported formats and the rio karma is a far better value .
the karma is only $5 more , it 's small , had a 20 gig drive and supports more formats including gog .
the karma doesn 't look as sexy but it 's interface is very efficiently designed .
after a week i tried to load some more songs and delete a few but the auto load didn 't do anything but turn on my player .
it seems like the software is just not responding .
the support has been less than impressive , considering the cost .
i 'm going to try to get a refund but considering all the hoops i jumped through ( emails , downloads , reboots , a purge and another download , plus reading through the help menu ) a refund should be twice as frustrating .
while the software may not be as easy as i-tunes , it is not difficult to use by any stretch .
if i was pressed to find a negative aspect of the zen micro i would probably have to mention weak fm reception , but the building where i primarily use the micro seems to have a history of terrible radio reception anyway , so you can take that for what it 's worth .
it had issues right off the bat , with freezing up , staying in 'shutting down ' mode , and just not functioning very well in general .
the touch-pad would be a great thing if it worked well , and as i never had issues getting songs transferred to the player , i did have problems accessing them from the player .
many other reviewers are mentioning that they have had no problems at all> i would say that the main problem is that this player is just not made very well .
it is the 'first generation ' of the player , and while i still agree that it is a great alternative to the ipod , i think there are many others that would be a much better value for your buck .
if someone asked me flat out , i 'd say to go woth something else .
i 've since replaced it with a pair of black sennheisers . . . not only are the packaged earbuds pretty uncomfortable , but are too similar to ipod 's and can target ipod thieves here in nyc .
although , i thought it could 've been designed a bit better .
it 's perfect for those who aren 't planning on storing tons of music .
weak points : - touch pad : design could be better - volume control : controlled through the vertical strip , but purchasing a headphone with built-in volume control will do the trick .
- radio quality : weak reception
the colors are a joke , and i personally hate the stupid vertical touchpad .
but my biggest gripe is still the extremely ugly design .
still has terrible software .
you have to wonder why creative can 't get this right .
screen review could be better .
apple still does it better but needs to come out with a 5 gig mini .
the touch buttons do take a little getting used to and i don 't like how the scroll button is the same button used as an " enter " key , but you get used to it and it isn 't a big deal .
the fm radio 's reception isn 't spectacular , but it will pick up the most powerful stations in any given metro area .
00% good though , and the zen does have a few drawbacks .
while transferring songs to the player , the interface has crashed a few times ( 4-5 times in a 4-5 hour period ) normally this would cause me major concern , but it appears that this bug is reproducible , which leads me to believe that creative will fix it with a patched version shortly ( or maybe it 's just my computer ) .
another thing i don 't like is that some of the features take 1-2 seconds to load up .
after consulting with creative 's customer support , they determined that the hard drive was broken and the only recourse was to send it in for repair , which would cost me $40 , since it 's past the 90 day warranty ( pretty short warranty ) .
well , i got my second player , and right out of the box it wasn 't working right and once again , after consulting customer se ! .
they obviously have quality and reliability problems .
they have a good concept here , and i normally expect a lot better quality from creative , so maybe they will do better with the next gen version , but for now i say buyer beware .
es , the interface took a little getting used to , but once i did , it 's almost second nature now .
only slight negatives i 've had so far is that i haven 't been able to get it to accept any of my wav files yet .
my other nit is that it didn 't include at least some kind of carrying case for everything .
yes , there is a belt clip , but that doesn 't hold the extra battery and usb cable .
the little bag it comes with is cheap and useless .
it barely holds anything and mine just puts a bunch of thread fuzzes all over the player , because the bag is cheap and seems to be coming apart .
it is not a perfect product but it does have a lot going for it .
on the downside , i think the interface takes some getting used to and the zen software ! .
is not as intuitive as i would like .
also , the earbuds that came with it sound great but are uncomfortable ( although my wife didn 't have a problem ) , so i bought a pair of over-the-ear headphones .
the touch pad is over-sensitive , and is adjustable to only slightly oversensitive .
the machine itself seems fine , but the software that came with it is awful .
after installation , the very first time i booted up the creative mediasource organizer , intending to use its cd burning and ripping functions , it totally shorted out .
i was up all night trying to make the stupid thing work , to no avail .
of course one of the first things i did was write an email to the customer support at creative , through their website , and by the time they finally got back to me - several working days later when they promise only one - their suggestions were completely worthless .
his is what i get for my $200 on this mp3 player ? .
it wouldn 't always work seamlessly with wmp and it often required me to restart the frozen micro by taking out the battery and restarting it .
as for the zen micro : \ cons : i read that every button is touch sensitive , and thats very annoying when all the main buttons are on the front .
putting the micro into your pocket could trigger just about anything ( unless the hold feature is improved : it asks if you want to " unholy " for every button up press ) second , i 'm worried about the durability of the player .
after research of other creative hard drive players , i found that most of them aren 't very durable and tend to crash ( read most reviews on amazon . com and see for yourself ) .
last , i find the price a bit expensive for a product such as this .
verdict : had i not needed something with a tad bit more space , i consider this player fair game .
it does take some getting used to .
whatever . . . on to the negatives : -touchy about charging . . . you can damage the battery and seriously decrease it 's life if you don 't upgrade the firmware or dont ' heed the advice to always plug in the player side of the cord before plugging in the outlet side .
it has the odd side effect of the buttons only partially working ? .
-user 's guide doesn 't cover a lot of important info that is covered on their website .
) -can 't be left in the car . . . it immediately shuts down with an overheating error if left in a hot car for too long .
i tried to use the fm radio option , but it doesn 't seem to really pick up the stations i listen , however i am going to try it in a different location , it may have just been my residential location .
even when i set it to low , it 's still very hard for me to adjust the player to where and what i want it to do .
i 've read about the issues with the scroll bar , but they must have taken care of that now .
the touchpad is virtually unusable -- sometimes you have to press like mad to make a selection and other times the slightest brush causes something to be selected that you don 't want .
another problem is that the latest 2 . 0 firmware upgrade moves you into windows media player 10 which seems to be very , very slow for downloads . charging[-2]
if you buying this player to use with napster to go , wait a while .
a lot of people are having problems with the firmware update required to use the player for napster to go . . the firmware is beta and they are are a lot of bugs in it .
imagine my disappointment , though , when the zen micro proved able to play only the mega-strongest fm signals in my area .
it seems like you need to park yourself right next to a radio tower for the micro to pull in a strong sound .
the battery , as others have said , also seems weaker than creative suggests .
still , that 's enough time that i 'm still satisfied , if a bit grouchy with creative 's over hyped promises .
respectable , solid , but not awe-inspiring .
where close to 12 hours but at least it is replaceable ( and they included a second one free ) .
i would give it about 6 or 7 hours , although it will probably get better after a few charge cycles .
the headphones which came with it are mediocre at best but what can you expect from a set of " ear buds " .
unfortunately i was wrong .
within one month , my player completely died .
( it had locked up multiple times previously , but always managed to work after wards ) this time , the touch screen wouldn 't respond to me and none of the buttons worked .
so i took out the battery and put it back in again , only to find that it would not work .
i had the second one for less than two weeks when i noticed a rattling/humming/buzzing sound while music was played .
i sent creative customer service 3 emails in which they did not help me one bit and don 't seem to even want to help .
it 's too bad , though , that ! .
the included headphones suck , so get your own .
the touch sarene navigation will take a little getting used to , but once you do , and while the zen is still alive , it 's a great alternative to the marching in lock step with the click wheel commies .
just too numerous to list : fm radio , which has weak reception , but at least it there , and a microphone , to name just two .
but , the creative zen micro is plagued by a serious , serious stupid and elemenatary design flaw , and i 'm going to tell you what it is . . . but first , two more things about this piece of garbage that 's so great and could 've made it a potential ipod killer .
but , all of this means nothing , because of the serious , serious , stupid and ridiculously elemenatary design flaw : after 3 months , give or take a few weeks , you won 't be able to hear anything .
because the " engineers " at creative screwed up the design of the headphone jack .
again , the headphone jack on this thing is garbage .
again , this is a design flaw in the headphone ! .
the flaw is inside the zen .
the flaw is in the circuit board that the headphone jack is connected to .
the creative zen micro is a zen micro killer , not an ipod killer .
why would anyone buy this when you can get a 20gb ipod that will hold 4 times the number of songs ( and even more if aac encoding is used ) for the same price ? . ? . ? .
to use the creative zen player with a subscription service , you need to go to creative 's web site , and download new software for your pc .
i haven 't seen any problems yet , but if you don 't like to tinker a bit , this player can be a little challenging to set up .
right now , the creative software transfers subscription music files very slowly .
this doesn 't affect standard mp3 files - just subscription wma files .
the subscription files are still a little slower to transfer , but it 's only by about 10% or so .
again , this doesn 't affect regular mp3 files - just subscription drm-encoded files , like those from napster-to-go or yahoo music unlimited .
i don 't know , maybe i got a defective one but first , the player would not shut off , next , the player would not come on - i had to send it away to get repaired .
now , the player 's ear phone jack is not working - i have to send it away again .
1 . pictures wo n 't transfer to pc directly from the camera using the included transfer cable .
. this camera keeps on outfoxing in auto mode with a buzzing sound which can 't be stopped .
. even the slightest of the shakes totally distorts your image
. images taken indoor were n 't so clear .
. lens cap is a really annoying
. the movie clips taken will always have some ' noise ' in it - you can 't avoid that .
within a year , there are problems with my menu dial knob .
i send my camera to nikon for servicing , took them a whole 6 weeks to diagnose the problem .
got a " system error " problem 30 days after purchase .
made the camera totally inoperable .
also , the lens cap design is flawed .
audio on video also lacking .
1 . pictures taken in an indoor setting are a little dull and rarely hazy if you tend to take photographs from a distance .
2 . it takes a while for the camera to actually capture the photograph from the time you click the button and i have seen people becoming a little impatient waiting for the flash to glow .
3 . the pictures come out hazy if your hands shake even for a moment during the entire process of taking a picture .
focusing on a display rack about 20 feet away in a brightly lit room during day time , pictures produced by this camera were blurry and in a shade of orange .
the inside pics , can be a bit challenging , but when you can instantly delete pics you dont like , that are not focused perfectly , or need lighting adjustments , make this camera very simple and effective .
the only things i have found that i havent liked is that the lcd is hard to read in daylight but everyone else's is too .
one downside though is that autofocus does not work well when battery is low .
it comes with a rechargable battery that does not seem to last all that long , especially if you use the flash a lot .
it does not have an auto-focus assist light which is nice for taking shots in low-light situations it allows the camera to focus in low light .
it has a 3x optical zoom , which is average for these cameras .
the only drawbacks i 've encountered are : 1 indoor shots from a distance > 8ft lack contrast and color , but i 've found this to be a problem with all cameras with built-in flashes that i 've used even on a nikon slr .
2 the battery life seems to be on the short side but adequate for most situations .
3 the picture editing software it came with is adequate , but not very robust .
on average , indoor shots with a flash are not quite as good as 35mm .
i only have one complaint , and that is the 8mb card included .
8mb for a camera like this is a joke .
1 no direct firewire to the camera .
2 the camera is so small that when you attach some lenses i have the 19mm wide-angle -- wc-e 68 , the optical viewfinder is partially obscured .
the only disappointment so far has been battery life .
mine generally requires a charge every 48 hours or so and i don 't really talk on it that much .
i purchased this phone knowing it was slightly old as compared to the newer models of nokia phones available .
i thought it was kind of steeply priced at that time .
anyhow some demerits of this phone , the phone has a slow processor and the ear volume is lower than 6610 but then the 6610 has the best ear volume among most nokia variants .
the battery life of this phone is at most 2 days and at least one day at excessive use .
video recording is limited at just 9 seconds .
you can upgrade but then there 's a certain level of trouble involved .
i 've had nokia 's for years , and while this one is packed with whiz bang features it is disappointing for its primary use - a phone .
on the plus side it 's packed with features , including bluetooth that works fine - it 's really a tiny computer that is also a phone . . . and that 's the negative .
as a computer , or pda its weak since the screen , while large by phone standards , is still tiny to really do anything on .
when you dial a number , you 'll need to check the screen to see that the number entered is correct .
you 'll do that because the keys are tightly packed in and your fingers will likely press two keys at once .
i hope you have a magnifying glass , because the number displayed as well as most of the pop up options are tiny .
it 's as though nokia has segregated 90% of the screen for fancy features rarely used and leave just 10% for the day to day use .
i 've have many nokia 's and while this is the best for features , it 's the worst as a phone .
my old siemens s56 , on the other hand , worked beautifully with all of the above .
who in the hell needs a frigging *vga* camera on their cellphone ? . ? . ? .
only thing i don 't like about it is slow in changing apps , boot up , and sometime it has problem connect thru bluetooth .
and , other else , the camera is still vga .
i must say , this one is quite slow to open an application .
sometimes , it needs few minutes to open an application .
but not good enough for me .
i have overall been disappointed with nokia in the past , finding that samsung and motorola tended to have better quality phones .
the only problem is that occasionally the joystick does start to dig into your thumb while gaming .
my biggest concern is that i have found nokia phones lower quality construction to lead to lower prices , but they also don 't last as long .
operation : it 's like bmw 's i-drive - it does it 's job , but has the most unintuitive , overly-layered interface .
the phone must be shut down & taken apart to change the memory card . . . and turning the phone back on takes a little while .
even the instruction booklet is out of order .
no matter how accustomed to the phone you become , too much time is required to get to , open and close applications .
the phone does not have an mp3-player , fm radio , 200k+ color screen , megapixel camera , quad band , pda , photo editor .
styling/ergonomics : the keys are small , which generally doesn 't bother me if they are spaced because i can employ a little 'braille , ' but the keys run into each other , so careful attn . must be paid when dialing .
it 's not as stylized as a sony or samsung .
the 6600 will provide similar service in more developed areas of the states and not as well in more remote areas .
the battery life can 't be very long ; . let 's not be greedy .
don 't use them , so i delete them for addle space .
when you consider expandability ( downloads via computer ) , the numerous features , two transmission programs and multiple storage devices , dependability - this is a phone that isn 't easy to out-grow .
bluetooth does not work on this phone .
though nearly a dozen different people at both t-mobile and nokia have told me otherwise , it is simply not possible to use this phone as a bluetooth modem for the vast majority of pdas and many other devices .
only then did i learn the truth -- this phone does not work with palm pdas ! .
this simple nuance was too much for nokia , and they still refuse to acknowledge the fact that their technician could have broken the phone or repair the phone for free .
in short - nokia themselves don 't know that this phone doesn 't work with the palm , and if you don 't heed my advice you will spend hours with technicians around the globe reading from scripts , chiding you in broken english for not following their directions exactly .
ultimately you will learn just how bad nokia is , and why their recent loss of market share is so utterly deserved .
the photos in the address book are terribly scaled too ; . they look as though they were built out of lego's .
it 's important that people know the following : first , the interface is slow .
you hit the message button on the front and it takes a matter of seconds to bring up the menu .
secondly , in addition to the lag each time you give a command , it 's just not that easily use able on the go .
the number buttons are crammed into a 3x4cm area , the fonts are small , the interface is too convoluted and frustrating , it 's not that customizable as well .
this phone is not suitable for fast people , maybe only for old people .
the menu pops up after 3 seconds the picture takes a while to load from its slow card memory .
the navigation takes so much time that it would eventually drive you crazy .
at first glance , i thought this phone was a little too big for me , maybe a little too complicated .
i can not find a carrier for this phone i like , end up just tossing it in my purse .
this phone doesn 't include phone card calling .
this process can be very annoying and unsafe when you are driving a stick shift on the highway .
my old sony ericsson t610 has this feature .
in noisy environment , it 's hard to hear from the earpiece .
speaker volume is loud and clear but it sacrifices the battery life .
unfortunately , i sold it exactly a month later .
1-a cell phone is to make calls , in other words , quality of reception and mic/speaker are the most important , the 6600 has a relatively low volume speaker , you 'd have to press it hard against your ear to hear anything the other person is saying , unless the surroundings were completely quiet .
2- it is bulky and the small buttons on the sides are sloppy to use .
3- it is slow , if you keep the original configuration and prigs ( why 'd u buy it then ? . ! . ) it 'll run smoothly , but still slower than most other coloured-screen nokias .
4- my idea was that it was an all-in-one , and that theory -once again- proves wrong , this phone ex cells at nothing , less than average in everything , if you seriously need any of the " other than phone " functionalists , you 'll be disappointed . . . . if you have lots of money and bought it for the love of gadgets then fine . . . . but don 't expect to get much done .
basically the 6600 is a bundle of over-hyped features you don 't and won 't need ( if you do get yourself a pda or pocket pc ) , none of them work as they should , and the basic phone functions and ergonomics are less than average .
i 'm an advocate of nokia , but this phone and the following models ( 7610 ) , are seemingly a desperate trial at squeezing as much under-engineered and experimental technologies in one sloppy phone .
i 'm giving it 1 star because as compared to other nokia phones , its a 1 , compared to other blunders by other companies ( such a samsung and motorola ) it might be good . . . . but if you 're getting a nokia , don 't get this one .
among its weak points is the mmc slot location and a bit vague design .
downside : it takes a long time to start up .
my last simpler nokia started right up and was immediately ready for use .
the " movies " last about 5 seconds .
i mean , they 're short ! .
i find this feature on this phone useless , but , since i don 't really need this function anyway , i don 't really use it .
also , when i dial an " 800 " number like an airline , it will not allow me to use number keys to navigate the prerecorded menu .
finally , after about a week 's use , the screen started to freeze on me .
it would not hang up on calls .
once it froze so bad i couldn 't even use the power button to turn it off , and had to open and take out the battery .
the only con i can think of is the lack of a mega-pixel camera .
they have the worst service of any of the major companies .
i really regret signing up with t-mobile , but i 'm stuck with them for the next 6 months of the contract .
just don 't get drawn into t-mobile 's catchy rebate .
t-mobile wasn 't upfront about some of the terms to qualify for the rebate .
the os is ab it confusing at 1st , but within a few days you will pass this learning curve ! .
i was using a motorola t720i with verizon and i had alot of dropped calls and i had troubles syncing data .
i saw a few complaints on the load time of menus and i feel people are over-exaggerating the menu load time .
on occasion i 'm not able to connect to the phone with isync via bluetooth but i found that rebooting the phone seems to solve this problem .
the video recorders a bit odd , sometimes i get 9 secs on my recordings , sometimes i get 17 .
i will say that the os that the phone runs does have a few issues .
sometimes , various applications crash .
especially the bluetooth server . . . meaning you have to restart the phone if you want bluetooth to work again .
this is somewhat annoying , but from working with computers ( especially windows -- ugh . . . )
the only main drawback is the fact that the voice-dialing system is kinda picky .
it takes a while to learn how to use it right , and at this point i am able to make about 70% of my calls using it .
however , it needs to be quite quiet for it to work at all -- dosn 't work at all in the car , for example .
some people have commented about the size and weight of the phone , and it has rightfully gotten the nick-name " the bar of soap " which , it really is .
the only problem is the size of the keys .
my fingers are kind of stubby so it took a while to learn how to hit a key without hitting the adjacent ones .
they really are awfully small .
also the battery life isn 't great but it 's sufficient for my needs .
the only downside i have found with this phone is that it is a bit slow to react , meaning when i push the contacts button , it takes a while to load , this is true for almost all the menus and programs on the phone .
these people takes lest effort to process rebate forms .
for last one month my rebate status showing me that my rebate is approved and check is delivered but still i am waiting for check .
there is no way you can talk with customer care about this .
dont rely on t-mobile rebates .
now the bad : 1 ) as usual , battery power not sufficient for daily usu age .
the battery power discharges rapidly especially on using the web browser .
2 ) phone is awfully slow .
sometimes when you press buttons , the menu appears after a second or two .
4 ) buttons are quite small and is really a pain exp if one is fond of text messaging .
there will be much erasing of text as , one would tend to type something instead of the actual letters .
5 ) video recorder is of no use and one can not record something useful in 10 seconds and it takes a while to send the same through the " free picture and video messaging " offered by service provider .
so , right out of the box i had issue .
namely , it wouldnt sync .
after scouring the various boards i find this is an arbitrary and pervasive problem .
but , i am quite unhappy with nokia at the moment .
if there was a zero-star rating i would give it .
downside is the size of the phone , it is big for today 's standard .
and the battery life is bad ! .
i could hardly use it without a recharge in 2 days ! .
a bit disappoint on that ! .
the gprs web access is slow ! .
you can 't do that with a sony t610 ( which i traded for a 6600 ) .
t610 supports only midi files .
after several years of torture in the hands of at&t customer service i am delighted to drop them , and look forward to august 2004 when i will convert our other 3 family-phones from at&t to t-mobile ! .
the day finally arrived when i was sure i 'd leave sprint .
after years with that carrier 's expensive plans and horrible customer service , portability seemed heaven-sent .
i spent hours setting up the stations ( accepts about 13-14 , i believe ) , though the reception is unpredictable .
the colors on the screen are not as crisp as i 'd have liked them to be .
the backlight on the phone goes off way too quickly ( dangerous when you 're driving at night ) , and there 's no way to change this --
the buttons on the phone are small , even for my small fingertips , but you get used to them rather quickly .
the menu options are uncreative , as you can 't see a full screen of menu items to pick from ; . you have to scroll up and down to find what you 're looking for ( yes , this is minor , but not when you 're trying to keep your eye on the road ! . ) .
the volume .
i have excellent hearing but the volume level on this phone is especially quiet .
i assumed they had exceptional service , but their reception in my area ( laos angele's ) is horrendous .
also , their t-zones , although cheap ( $ 4 . 99 / mo . ) never works .
since i received the phone , i spent countless hours on the phone with customer service reps who promised t-zones would work " in 24 hours " .
i must have heard this about a dozen times over the span of 2 weeks , when t-zones never worked .
apparently , t-mobile is heavily back-logged and can 't keep up with demands .
however , the calls constantly drop in my area and i experience mega-static , to the point where i 'd have to dial numbers 6-7 times to get a clear line .
the volume level of the phone is not all that good .
some of the higher pitched rings are very easy to hear , but not easy to listen to .
the more subtle tones that were included with the phone are hard to hear at times .
the vibration is not top .
i am bored with the silver look .
they are not wow able good .
it also does n 't have voice activated dialing . big minus ! . ! .
we got two phones for the t-mobile family plan ( indeed very easy to switch to the family plan ) and one came with a broken headphone ( can hear but can not be heard ) and one died today after less than two weeks of use .
when i got it home , i discovered that the menu options for sending messages via either text or email simply were n 't there :
negative : impossibly tiny and difficult to operate , barely visible , power button .
poor visibility on the keys .
only con i can think of is no camera . . . .
only one complaint about the speakerphone , you can only activate the speakerphone feature once the person you are calling answers the phone , not while it is ringing .
the only problem i had was a small glitch with t-mobile .
the phone has a few minor inconveniences , but only because it lacks those features , bluetooth and high spend internet , but there are very few problems with things that you expected this phone to do .
ring tones only come with crazy songs and annoying rings , there is only one ring that sounds close to a regular ring .
the screen is easily scratched but if you have the warranty you should be able to swap it out .
games kind of stink and you cant download them you have to get the link cable to get additional games .
buttons do seem a little sticky tho . . and the hands free kits ' connector might be a problem . .
the keys are close together , and the layout is a bit funky in relation to standard rectangular layout keypads , but it 's not too weird .
the fact that the " 0 " key is the space key for text input is a bit confusing , as many phones use the " # " key instead .
there are some features in the user interface that i find a little inconvenient .
the menu options appear one at a time , taking up the whole screen , and one has to scroll down one by one , or have memorized where they are in the menu order , to select them by using the number keypad .
the vibrate setting is loud ! .
so loud , really , that it does n 't work terribly well as a silent ringer option .
other things that i miss are voice-activated dialing and a standard 2 . 5 mm headset jack .
- some features in the user interface
- no voice activated dialing ( what were they thinking
- no option for caller-id pictures or individualized ringtones .
- no proprietary headset jack
only if we could get one camera in it . .
the volume key can be hard to press , but i think this may be by design rather than a flaw , perhaps to keep you from pressing it accidentally when you are in a call .
pc cable is too expensive . . . $ 50 for a usb cable ? .
the 6610 has the radio function which is utterly useless .
it also has a stock tracking app built in ( also useless ) and a somewhat useful application which converts all types of metrics ( currency , length , area , etc ) .
regarding pc software support nokia suite does not work with some versions of xp as i tried to connect my phone via infrared port on my laptop .
its quiet .
i do here a constant high-pitched distorted sound , not to mention the volume does not seem to be loud enough .
although i find it more convenient to use 1-touch dialing , this phone does not have voice dialing .
the keypad is a decent size , but the power on/off key is small and difficult to press .
in my opinion the worst issue on this phone is the side-mounted volume control .
one other issue is that the headphone jack is unique to nokia , so standard headphones will not work .
one complaint . . . the screen is too easily scratched ! .
one more thing , the default ringtones that come with the phone are horrible .
the only problem that i have found with the internet service is that it does not access mils ( real estate broker software ) very well at all .
i find the lack of entertaining games on this phone quite disturbing .
my only gripe about the hardware is the buttons .
this model does have the traditional key arrangement , it 's just that they are really close to one another , and have unconventional shapes , so it takes a big getting used to for someone like me with big hands .
finally , i reiterate my thumbs-down rating for t-mobile as a carrier .
their network coverage is very sporadic , and the network always seems overloaded , resulting in very unpleasant calling experience .
unfortunately , the 6610 does not offer voice dialing like my previous phone , but the other features it packs outweighs this shortcoming .
one downside : as of this writing , t-mobile has n 't updated their t-zone system to fully support the 6610 .
the one huge disappointment is that the phones manufactured for t-mobile lack many of the menus and functions that a nokia straight from the manufacturer should have .
the internet functions of the phone - wap and gprs - will only work through t-mobile 's services , because they have deleted the menu options that would enable you to configure the phone to be used on a different network .
however , the main problem that i think is the with the sound quality .
when talking the voice is not very clear .
there isn 't much features on the ipod at all , except games .
it has an equalizer , but the iriver h10-20gb has a lot more presets than the ipod .
durability : not good . first problem , if you haven 't seen the news recently , the ipods are being recalled for battery problems and not lasting the advertised 18 months .
also , the battery 's aren 't user replaceable .
another thing you should know , the metal on the flip side of the ipod is very tacky , and scratches very easily .
also , not liking the gel case .
features : really , there aren 't any features , unless you call the games a feature .
there is no fm tuner , while there is no fm tuner on the creative zen ( on the micro version of the zen there is a tuner ) , the iriver h10-20gb , the rio karma , and the audio x5 have fm tuners .
there is also no voice recording , something most if not all mp3 players have that the ipod doesn 't .
there is no photo viewing option , however , there is a 20 gb photo ipod , but it costs $20 more .
i 'm probably the only person that dislikes the itunes software .
customer service : awful . listen to this one , remember the battery statement i made earlier .
there technical service isn 't helpful either ; . they just read what 's on their website and charge you $50 ( + toll fees ) to do it .
doesn 't have alot of good games on it .
the back of the ipod is in a chrome finish , and this surface is prone to scratches .
but i had to give you four because the service for my brand-new ipod was terribly slow .
the interface took a little getting used to .
one caveat i have is that i understand the ipod does not save the photos in such a way that the quality of the image is preserved .
cons : no am/fm radio tuner -- something a large number of compete tors are doing
3 no voice recorder -- this has also become an important and popular feature that the ipod unfortunately doesn 't have .
no memory stick slots -- although a rare feature , it would be nice to have extra storage , not that it needs it built-in lithium battery -- a huge hassle to bring this back ; . draining the battery once you get it helps , but removable/replaceable ones are a lot more convenient
no in box accessories -- an arm strap , belt strap , case , or anything would be nice , but nope . . . moveable parts -- this makes me almost want to keep my 3rd gen over a 4th ; . with moveable parts , its easy to damage an ipod at a gym , so this is for more casual listeners ; . note the ipod mini doesn 't have moveable parts and is made of titanium .
the battery issue is superficially a concern , but any reasonable solder-jockey ( such as myself : - ) can pop in a new one when the time comes ( based upon the plentiful info gained from a go ogle for 'ipod battery replacement ' ) .
first , let me say that i got the 20gb ipod for christmas , and i most likely would not have spent the $300 myself .
in addition , i do not think the battery lasts much more than eight to ten hours , and it can take four hours for a full charge .
*the ipod is overly sensitive to just about everything and gets scratched easily .
the battery does not last 12 hours .
you can 't change the battery , so i don 't know what i 'm going to do in a year or so .
*
my ipod freezes occasionally , which is especially annoying when you 're in the middle of a game of " brick . " *
if you call apple and tell them your ipod has been damaged , they charge you roughly $105 . 50 per minute and blame you for " abusing " your ipod .
the user support service isn 't too great either .
the ipod comes formatted for the mac , but within seconds of plugging it into a pc , is automatically reformatted for windows . ( the hp version comes with windows formatting , and takes seconds to change to mac . ) although the ipod can be changed from one format to another , you will lose all of your music and data when doing so .
its steel backing picks up fingerprints and scratches easily , not great from a cosmetic standpoint .
holy cow ! . it really does scratch easily ! .
the thing has survived plenty of falls with little or no damage , except the inevitable scratches .
apple closed their island to anything that resembled microsoft , and clearly let napster know it could not use their products with napster 's services .
as a windows user , i had to install the software including drivers and itunes on my desktop , and this is the only area where i encountered a nuisance .
my only complaint ( really more of an observation ) is that the outside finish of the ipod is rather delicate , so i am going to get a case for mine so it doesn 't get all scratched up .
if there were any complaints i have , they are marginal , but one is apples ' proprietary set-up for music files , their incompatibility with other music services ( i . e . napster ) is down right wrong .
also , some other mp3 players such as the nitrus allow you to play wma ( windows media audio ) files , whereas the ipod does not .
as with most headphones that come with any type of music player , i recommend throwing these into the nearest river , unless you like having hard , round pieces of plastic in your ears .
because steve jobs is a twisted individual and he made sure that he ruined this device by giving it an unrepeatable 18 month battery .
this was obviously a conspiracy as it is freak in ' easy to manufacture a device with replaceable batteries ! . ! .
however , in my mind , $299 is a lot to pay for a device that will only last 18 months .
looks and durability : i realize many people are fond of the minimalist white interface .
the biggest red flag for me was the fact that although my cousin 's player was relatively new , it was riddled with scratches .
battery : compared to the other players on the market , the ipod has one of the worst batteries around .
maybe this new design is more durable than the last , but i kind of doubt it .
we can start by losing the shiny miracle-material cover that you can literally scratch just by looking at it wrong , and thus eliminate the need for third-party " asking " protective covers for an extra thirty bucks .
first of all , i 've never been big on earbuds - they 're just not that comfortable .
and if you 're a mac user like me , they 've naturally made sure you have no viable alternative .
however , the battery life isn 't as good as i would like .
cons breaks easily .
hard drive screws up occasionally
this is only a problem at night , during the day the screen is very easy to see .
the only problem is the battery life .
apple 's ipod battery replacement service costs $100 ! .
i have read the installation instructions for both nis 2004 and navy 2004 prior to installation , but still ended up with the same result . . . junk software .
but if i installed either one of these norton products , neither works after installation ? .
i have used norton for the past 5 years and for the last 2 years , the software has gotten more and more disgraceful .
i am glad that i do not work for norton .
after 4 attempted installs , i have finally given up .
during install , nis would either freeze or not reboot properly when asked to do so .
the ms scandisk would appear due to manual shutdown and would only scan to the 2nd bar , over and over ( up to 1 hr , i then shut it down and used go back ) .
i have never had this problem with any other software on my computer .
being a past norton customer , i consider this to be a slap to my face .
buying software that can not be installed normally and being put into the position of having a non-working computer .
norton has been on a downhill slid recently with their products , but with this one , they have fallen off the cliff .
as a loyal customer of norton/symantec products , i purchased internet security 2004 as a software firewall and could not be any more dissatisfied with the product ( and hence the one star rating ) .
yeah - this program protects your computer all right - by locking you off the internet .
other than that it is all the same except the new updates .
so far i haven 't had so much complaints except that i still haven 't mastered how to scandisk when using internet security .
too bad the product is cumbersome and intertwined trying to do so much at one time .
sometimes a suite is not a good deal and all you get is a bundle of headaches .
norton internet security 2004 is one of the more buggy implementations .
this product has virtually all the same installation problems .
for purposes of clarity , here is my review from that product , edited to be appropriate for this product , since , for the most part , they share many of the same problems .
this version of internet security 2004 , is beyond hope .
they are a royal pain to install , and don 't function properly once finally installed -- if you can install them at all .
the biggest problem is the installation .
also if you do manage to get it installed , any problems with liveupdate or with system works will also affect the functionality and/or the process of updating internet security .
i 've had to install and uninstall them four or five times so far , and i 've not to get either product working properly .
first , it serious , serious installation problems .
back in may 2004 , when i first reviewed this , it had taken me over 16 hours to install and run .
almost from the beginning , liveupdate would not function .
first , it failed whenever connecting to get updates .
when i finally got it working , it only worked properly for many a month .
the next problem was that it didn 't recognize all the installed components , so it would not update them , most notably and importantly , virus definitions .
but this doesn 't make up for it 's innumerable other short-comings , the biggest of which is the inability to download any updates due to problems with liveupdate .
the other annoyance with this that you have to remove every single remnant of previous version of norton systemworks before you installs this .
warning ! . the windows " remove program " feature does not do a good job of this , and neither does norton 's own removal program .
a lot of " fragments " were left in the registry , and it the norton system folders .
if you have an older version of " internet security " installed , you may also need to remove it as well before proceeding with systemworks install .
you also need to go in and manually remove many symantec files from the registry .
as of october , 2004 , these products are not working and i 'm ready to demand a refund from symantec .
i just uninstalled systemworks and internet security for at least the fifth time due to functionality issues .
once again it won 't reinstall , even with online and email assistance from symantect technicians .
the best thing to do with this version , is to leave it on the store shelf . it doesn 't work , and will cost you an enormous amount of your time , not to mention your hard earned dollars .
personally , i may never buy symantect products again .
avoid this product at all costs .
there are some highs to the 2004 edition , but mostly lows .
the program brings more problems than a virus , albeit not as major problems , just not what you expect for 70 bucks .
i had a question about the pros and cons of turning off the norton firewall vs . the windows firewall , and waited 45 minutes to speak with a tech support representative because i did not have a " customer priority id number . "
then when i went to norton 's website to obtain a priority id number per the instructions i had been given , i couldn 't find a way to get one .
so i e-mailed the online tech support with that simple question , and got a reply which was totally unresponsive ( it looked as though they didn 't actually read the e-mail and just sent back a few boilerplate paragraphs ) .
and , when you think about it , it 's insulting that norton requires its customers to jump through these hoops -- anyone who can provide proof of purchase , whether on the phone or online ( what if your computer is down ? . ) , should have equal priority .
stay away from this product ! .
i don 't know what 's happened to norton , but 2004 is absolute garbage .
the customer support is pathetic .
i have found too many bugs in norton internet security professional to recommend it to any one without extreme patience and experience .
this product is absolutely not ready for release .
it is buggy , slow and basically frustrates the heck out of the user .
i am an it professional and have used norton for years , but this product is a complete and utter dud .
it 's a rip off if one buys norton internet security and antivirus .
nothing spectacular is done by internet security or by antivirus software .
even though i have the parental controls off it constantly starts updating them then freezes my computer .
now in october , 2004 , the firewall said i couldn 't ok anymore software to use the internet because its full .
im at full capacity ! . ! . ! . ! . i called syman tic and they said they don 't know why but i should get tech 's support at $35/hr to help ! . ! . i did call them and was on hold for 55 minutes until i hung up ! .
so , don 't buy this or upgrade .
if you currently own the 2003 version , and are looking to upgrade to the 2004 version , don 't .
there is little meaningful difference between the two versions aside from the tedious activation process , and the product is currently rather buggy and has problems running unless cleanly installed on a formatted drive .
if you are new to the market and looking to buy a symantec software product , save yourself some money and buy the 2003 version .
from day one , we 've had hangups , crashes , glitches , continual reboots , long shutdowns due to " cc app . exe " program running which is a norton program .
long reboots due to norton taking forever to boot .
we constantly got " windows virtual memory low " error messages popping up foll wed by ridiculous slowdowns and/or crashes .
norton online support does not even acknowledge this problem nor does the computer company that preloaded it on our new computer .
norton support is completely pathetic .
do not buy any home version of norton anything .
our norton internet/av 2004 was terrible right from the get go , so i 'd think that if steelworks is ok now , it should remain ok .
just the home version of norton internet/av has too many glitches and problems to even remotely bother with .
i am an advanced computer user , so i can not even imagine how a new or novice user would ever get this terrible program to work ! .
seems the " program scan " feature did not find the exe file for outlook ! .
like most of their solutions ( which first blame other applications for errors ) , the tech persons line was that this was probably a microsoft error - it was not .
it was a symantec error .
after a recent update , i can no longer open more then 1 browser window .
i 've searched the program and their online tech support ( worthless ) and have found no solutions .
this is definitely one of those products , especially as the company is leaning more towards making a profit .
the only problem i had was a few components didn 't quite load correctly upon startup , but a reboot fixed the problem .
i give it 4-stars only because the installation process - or rather problems that may surface during the installation process - can be frustrating to the average computer user .
if you experience problems with installation , you can visit symantec 's website , click the support tab , click the 'home or home office support ' and there is an automated support assistant that can scan the norton program files on your computer and it will tell you what is not working right and how to fix it .
can 't get easier than that ! .
i already knew something was wrong , because much of the spam i 've seen in the past six months was from resellers of norton products .
i read many reviews on norton i . s . 2004 from a variety of sources ( cnet , amazon , message boards ) and came to the conclusion that nis 04 was a terrible product and not worth the update .
booting up my computer took forever ! . ! . ! .
then , my ad/pop-up blocking was completely gone .
my file log was not responding and the program was not blocking any cookies or unauthorized sites .
again , every review written about the tech line is true . . . after waiting close to 45 minutes i finally spoke to a rep .
after telling the rep and his tech supervisor the problem the only answer was to uninstall the program ( which i had already done ) . . .
they didn 't know what the problem could be .
i did it and it was worse the second time around . . . unbelievable .
basically , i ate the cost of the renewal and ate the cost of the tech help .
unfortunately , it does not give you the option of installing ( or installing ) them individually .
you can " disable " some of the individual components , but don 't be fooled -- they 're still there and running .
although i disabled norton antispam , it is still there .
but those 2 come up every time .
next , the big reason not to buy any norton product : if there 's a problem with it , norton charges $30 to even tell them about it .
sure they say if it 's their fault you won 't get charged , but they are the ones who get to decide whether it 's their fault .
the problems i had installing norton extended way beyond what symantec should reasonably expect the public to deal with .
when i purchase software , i never want to have to spend hours looking up solutions to my install problems -- in particular solutions that involve manually setting driver preferences or editing the registry ! .
i downloaded this set from norton , and within minutes my internet connection failed and my pc was almost dead due to registry problems from the download .
their site offers no live help at all .
i tried to call norton , and the only numbers they list on their sites are either for non-tech customer service ( tried this one and hung up after 75 minute of muzak ) or they have a $30 tech-support number .
who wants to pay $30 to discuss a defect in a product that just cost $95 ? . ( i also bought the back-up cd ) .
i finally got a free support number for norton through my usp support staff , but waited an hour or more for a voice .
they said they would refund all the money , but a month later , they tell me now the back-up disc is not refundable as its cost is purely handling and shipping - $15 to " handle " and ship a cd ? . -- and they have been indignant and combative on the phone and in emails .
this is a terrible company with a bad product and awful support .
after 10 years , i now downloaded mccaffee 's product after calling their support . . . . they answered quickly , and for free , and were very helpful .
no problems now , just a sickly disappointment in the way norton has abandoned their customers .
i see many other reviews that say the same . . . . stay away from norton , they don 't deserve you , or anyone ! .
i 've always liked symantec products , except for this version 2004 .
if you are already using a previous version of nortron security and uni stalled it to install the new version , you will still have all kind of problems in installing the new version on your system ! .
to install that version you have to uninstall from the window registery anything called symantec or nortron , . . . also from the common files in the program folder the symantec folder has to be deleted .
if you have no previous version of nortron security on your system , or nortron antivirus , the installation will go fine , otherwise dig in and in to do a major registery clean up ! . the old programs will leave a trace that will mess up the new installation , even if you uninstalled the old programs perfectly .
what disappoints me the most that a software like that is not cheap gets zero support form symantec , if you want support , they 'll charge you a fee ! .
i am giving a zero star to symantec for this version ! .
the only way my pc internet works is if i open the firewall program configuration and manually refresh it .
symantec should give us all a refund and apology ! .
i will never buy their product again at this rate , and neither should you .
however , symantec has taken a significant turn for the worse with this release .
i 'm currently using a sony vaio s-150 ( which i bought at the end of this past august ) , and it takes about five minutes just to boot the system - in fact , i 've taken to just hibernating , rather than shutting down completely .
however , i am very disappointed with this product and with symantec .
it feels like i 'm back to the days of 56k dial-up internet service , even though i 'm running a dell 2ghz pentium 4 with 256mb memory and have had excellent broadband service for the past year .
i tried disabling the various components provided with this product , paring it all the way back to anti-virus only service . . . and saw no improvement .
there is absolutely nothing useful at the symantec/norton site .
however , i suspect that many people are having a bad experience -- do not purchase this product .
this program would not let me send outlook email or listen to audible sample books online .
buy this if you like mental challenges or trying how to pick locks .
i had much of the same problems that everyone else has listed ( mainly the slow processor ) , and then i couldn 't get the damn thing off my computer completely ! .
it locked during install and i had to reformat the drive and start from scratch ( greer ! . )
and i can 't warn you enough to stay away from norton ! . ! .
it was immediately noticeable that nis slows down my computer ( pent4 , 256 ram ) .
i think it is a combination of the program size taking up resources and the open/close scanning that it does with every program .
is it necessary to scan my ms money database when i close the program ? .
i have a modern pc with lots of speed and memory , but this firewall just brought it to a halt .
start up , log off , log on . . . everything became very slow .
configuring it for a home network was almost impossible .
multiple users on one machine never seemed to behave like you 'd expect .
while i was trying to play half life 2 it started popping up with " alerts " every twenty seconds ( literally ) , warning me my antivirus protection was off .
but it wouldn 't let me turn the av protection back on and it wouldn 't stop with the alerts .
i had tried to uninstall norton internet security a few weeks ago , and it wouldn 't let me do that either .
i tried it again this morning and it said i didn 't have the required " permissions " and lacked proper administrator status .
of course , if you try to reach symantec customer service you get useless automated systems unless you want to pay $30 per incident .
this time , it started the installation process , then i left for work . i think it will work . i hope it will work .
i simply hate symantec . i swear , if i could have physically ripped that software out of my computer with my bare , bleeding hands , i would have .
