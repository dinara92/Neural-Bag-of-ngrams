slowly but surely devolves into a fascinating , cringe-inducing portrait of cultural solipsism , climaxing in an emotional meltdown that wouldn't look out of place in mid-period cassavetes . 
a feel-good picture in the best sense of the term . 
it's lazy for a movie to avoid solving one problem by trying to distract us with the solution to another . 
scorsese doesn't give us a character worth giving a damn about . 
it's hard not to like a film that has sky divers jumping out of helicopters to catch flying dragons in a big net . 
none of this is half as moving as the filmmakers seem to think . 
what was once original has been co-opted so frequently that it now seems pedestrian . 
this idea has lost its originality . . . and neither star appears very excited at rehashing what was basically a one-joke picture . 
to show these characters in the act and give them no feelings of remorse -- and to cut repeatedly to the flashback of the original rape -- is overkill to the highest degree . 
this is a terrific character study , a probe into the life of a complex man . 
plodding , poorly written , murky and weakly acted , the picture feels as if everyone making it lost their movie mojo . 
it's mildly sentimental , unabashedly consumerist . . . studiously inoffensive and completely disposable . 
a touching , small-scale story of family responsibility and care in the community . 
its juxtaposition of overwrought existentialism and stomach-churning gore will have you forever on the verge of either cracking up or throwing up . 
just as moving , uplifting and funny as ever . 
a little weak -- and it isn't that funny . 
as [the characters] get more depressed , the story gets more tiresome , especially as it continues to mount a conspicuous effort to be profound . 
if the count of monte cristo doesn't transform caviezel into a movie star , then the game is even more rigged than it was two centuries ago . 
so putrid it is not worth the price of the match that should be used to burn every print of the film . 
a muddle splashed with bloody beauty as vivid as any scorsese has ever given us . 
a romantic comedy that operates by the rules of its own self-contained universe . 
quiet , sexual , disturbing , often beautifully melancholic . 
the movie's progression into rambling incoherence gives new meaning to the phrase 'fatal script error . '
the movie's accumulated force still feels like an ugly knot tightening in your stomach . but is that knot from dramatic tension or a symptom of artistic malnutrition ? 
no way i can believe this load of junk . 
its weighty themes are too grave for youngsters , but the story is too steeped in fairy tales and other childish things to appeal much to teenagers . 
what the director can&#8217 ; t do is make either of val kilmer&#8217 ; s two personas interesting or worth caring about . 
[grant's] bumbling magic takes over the film , and it turns out to be another winning star vehicle . 
renner's performance as dahmer is unforgettable , deeply absorbing . 
all these developments and challenges facing santa weigh down the plot so heavily that they drain all the film of its energy and needlessly strain credibility . 
what might have been readily dismissed as the tiresome rant of an aging filmmaker still thumbing his nose at convention takes a surprising , subtle turn at the midway point . 
the film is a contrivance , as artificial as the video games japanese teens play in a nightclub sequence , but it's an enjoyable one . 
the movie weighs no more than a glass of flat champagne . 
prancing his way through the tailor-made part of a male hooker approaching the end of his vitality , jagger obviously relishes every self-mocking moment . 
carrying this wafer-thin movie on his nimble shoulders , chan wades through putrid writing , direction and timing with a smile that says , 'if i stay positive , maybe i can channel one of my greatest pictures , drunken master . '
this real-life hollywood fairy-tale is more engaging than the usual fantasies hollywood produces . 
 . . . there's a choppy , surface-effect feeling to the whole enterprise . 
riveting when it focuses on the challenges of crossing a generational divide . 
a fanciful drama about napoleon's last years and his surprising discovery of love and humility . 
for the future , one hopes mr . plympton will find room for one more member of his little band , a professional screenwriter . 
the problems of the people in love in the time of money are hardly specific to their era . they just have problems , which are neither original nor are presented in convincing way . 
with all the sympathy , empathy and pity fogging up the screen . . . his secret life enters the land of unintentional melodrama and tiresome love triangles . 
a film of empty , fetishistic violence in which murder is casual and fun . 
viewers will need all the luck they can muster just figuring out who's who in this pretentious mess . 
jeffs has created a breathtakingly assured and stylish work of spare dialogue and acute expressiveness . 
has a shambling charm . . . a cheerfully inconsequential diversion . 
a comedy-drama of nearly epic proportions rooted in a sincere performance by the title character undergoing midlife crisis . 
it's their familial ups and downs that shift this small , stubbornly poignant documentary . . . from the realm of special-interest audiences to the more universal theater of family psychodynamics . 
watching trouble every day , at least if you don't know what's coming , is like biting into what looks like a juicy , delicious plum on a hot summer day and coming away with your mouth full of rotten pulp and living worms . 
it's like going to a house party and watching the host defend himself against a frothing ex-girlfriend . you don't want to call the cops . you want to call domino's . 
it's an often-cute film but either needs more substance to fill the time or some judicious editing . 
holofcener rejects patent solutions to dramatize life's messiness from inside out , in all its strange quirks . 
genuine movie magic . . . it transports you to a place somewhere between eavesdropping voyeur and silent referee . 
a 94-minute travesty of unparalleled proportions , writer-director parker seems to go out of his way to turn the legendary wit's classic mistaken identity farce into brutally labored and unfunny hokum . 
it picked me up , swung me around , and dropped me back in my seat with more emotional force than any other recent film . 
despite the film's bizarre developments , hoffman keeps us riveted with every painful nuance , unexpected flashes of dark comedy and the character's gripping humanity . 
it has something of the aura of four weddings and a funeral about it , mixed in with a bit of bridget jones's diary , but the movie's just too different , too risky for huge popularity . 
 . . . the plot weaves us into a complex web . 
a reasonably efficient mechanism , but it offers few surprises and finds its stars slumming in territory they should have avoided . 
i enjoyed " formula 51 " in a guilty kind of way
even when crush departs from the 4w formula . . . it feels like a glossy rehash . 
the ch�teau would have been benefited from a sharper , cleaner script before it went in front of the camera . not to mention a sharper , cleaner camera lens . 
novak manages to capture a cruelly hilarious vein of black comedy in the situation with his cast of non-actors and a gritty , no-budget approach . 
the problem with this film is that it lacks focus . i sympathize with the plight of these families , but the movie doesn't do a very good job conveying the issue at hand . 
could use a little more humanity , but it never lacks in eye-popping visuals . 
a reminder that beyond all the hype and recent digital glitz , spielberg knows how to tell us about people . 
the film is hampered by its predictable plot and paper-thin supporting characters . 
if your senses haven't been dulled by slasher films and gorefests , if you're a connoisseur of psychological horror , this is your ticket . 
the off-center humor is a constant , and the ensemble gives it a buoyant delivery . 
as his circle of friends keeps getting smaller one of the characters in long time dead says 'i'm telling you , this is f * * * ed' . maybe he was reading the minds of the audience . 
it's hard not to feel you've just watched a feature-length video game with some really heavy back story . 
'you'll laugh for not quite and hour and a half , but come out feeling strangely unsatisfied . you'll feel like you ate a reeses without the peanut butter . . . '
best enjoyed as a work of fiction inspired by real-life events . those seeking a definitive account of eisenstein's life would do better elsewhere . 
with we were soldiers , hollywood makes a valiant attempt to tell a story about the vietnam war before the pathology set in . 
like a fish that's lived too long , austin powers in goldmember has some unnecessary parts and is kinda wrong in places . 
the sequel drops the adult aspects of the story in favor of talking reindeer and a life-size , plastic santa replacement ( also played by allen ) that is strongly reminiscent of that creepy family from the duracell commercials . 
an unremarkable , modern action/comedy buddy movie whose only nod to nostalgia is in the title . 
a romantic comedy enriched by a sharp eye for manners and mores . 
what emerges is not only an underdog v . simon bar sinister saga but a fascinating character study .

the best movie in many a moon about the passions that sometimes fuel our best achievements and other times leave us stranded with nothing more than our lesser appetites . 
add yet another hat to a talented head , clooney's a good director . 
the crime matters less than the characters , although the filmmakers supply enough complications , close calls and double-crosses to satisfy us . 
swimming isn't a major film . nor does it try to be . but what , in the end , is a major film ? if it's one that accomplishes what it sets out to do , then we ought to correct ourselves .

embarrassed myself about laughing out loud multiple times , i found myself enjoying the movie much more than i ever enjoyed the tv show . . . and these pseudo-homo-erotic stunts . 
aimed squarely at the least demanding of demographic groups : very small children who will be delighted simply to spend more time with familiar cartoon characters . 
part of the draw of dance is the impossibility to define its particular joy . tavernier's film conveys a large element of its appeal -- and more .

despite its faults , this is a fascinating look at a subculture . 
less worrying about covering all the drama in frida's life and more time spent exploring her process of turning pain into art would have made this a superior movie . 
ultimately , it ponders the reasons we need stories so much . 
the irony is that this film's cast is uniformly superb ; their performances could have -- should have -- been allowed to stand on their own . 
an inexperienced director , mehta has much to learn . 
sounding like arnold schwarzenegger , with a physique to match , [ahola] has a wooden delivery and encounters a substantial arc of change that doesn't produce any real transformation . 
mib ii is a movie that makes it possible for the viewer to doze off for a few minutes or make several runs to the concession stand and/or restroom and not feel as if he or she has missed anything . that's because relatively nothing happens . 
shadyac , who belongs with the damned for perpetrating patch adams , trots out every ghost trick from the sixth sense to the mothman prophecies . 
huppert's superbly controlled display of murderous vulnerability ensures that malice has a very human face . 
makes an aborbing if arguable case for the man's greatness . 
as an entertainment , the movie keeps you diverted and best of all , it lightens your wallet without leaving a sting . 
most of the information has already appeared in one forum or another and , no matter how broomfield dresses it up , it tends to speculation , conspiracy theories or , at best , circumstantial evidence . 
so muddled , repetitive and ragged that it says far less about the horrifying historical reality than about the filmmaker's characteristic style . 
any film that doesn't even in passing mention political prisoners , poverty and the boat loads of people who try to escape the country is less a documentary and more propaganda by way of a valentine sealed with a kiss . 
a tender , witty , captivating film about friendship , love , memory , trust and loyalty . 
professionally speaking , it's tempting to jump ship in january to avoid ridiculous schlock like this shoddy suspense thriller . 
a pointed , often tender , examination of the pros and cons of unconditional love and familial duties . 
ben affleck as jack ryan , tom clancy's intrepid hero ? ridiculous . what's next ? d . j . qualls as indiana jones ? or tom green as han solo ? 
i basically went in expecting garbage , but color me surprised when it actually turned out to be quite funny ! 
the film tunes into a grief that could lead a man across centuries . 
turning a great movie into a pretty good one is still a step in the wrong direction . . . and the ring will never be more than a pretty good movie . 
formula 51 is pretty much quentin tarantino meets guy ritchie , as directed by ronny yu . however , if you like that sort of thing , as i do , you just might have some fun with the chemical imbalance of formula 51 . 
at once emotional and richly analytical , the cosby-seinfeld encounter alone confirms the serious weight behind this superficially loose , larky documentary . 
the sweetest thing is expressly for idiots who don't care what kind of sewage they shovel into their mental gullets to simulate sustenance . 
i'm not sure which will take longer to heal : the welt on johnny knoxville's stomach from a riot-control projectile or my own tortured psyche . 
the advantage of a postapocalyptic setting is that it can be made on the cheap . any rock pile will do for a set . reign of fire has the disadvantage of also looking cheap . 
an engaging documentary about people who live in unusual homes . 
kung pow is oedekerk's realization of his childhood dream to be in a martial-arts flick , and proves that sometimes the dreams of youth should remain just that . 
a film without surprise geared toward maximum comfort and familiarity . 
sorvino makes the princess seem smug and cartoonish , and the film only really comes alive when poor hermocrates and leontine pathetically compare notes about their budding amours . 
secretary is not a movie about fetishism . it is a movie about passion . 
it proves quite compelling as an intense , brooding character study . 
outrageousness is all plympton seemed to be going for this time . we miss the quirky amazement that used to come along for an integral part of the ride .

those with a modicum of patience will find in these characters' foibles a timeless and unique perspective . 
swims in mediocrity , sticking its head up for a breath of fresh air now and then . 
if you're part of her targeted audience , you'll cheer . otherwise , maybe . 
julia is played with exasperating blandness by laura regan . 
the problem with all of this : it's not really funny . 
not really a thriller so much as a movie for teens to laugh , groan and hiss at . 
viewing this underdramatized but overstated film is like watching a transcript of a therapy session brought to humdrum life by some freudian puppet . 
as an actor's showcase , hart's war has much to recommend it , even if the top-billed willis is not the most impressive player . as a story of dramatic enlightenment , the screenplay by billy ray and terry george leaves something to be desired . 
there's plenty to enjoy -- in no small part thanks to lau . 
charly comes off as emotionally manipulative and sadly imitative of innumerable past love story derisions . 
it's incredible the number of stories the holocaust has generated . just when you think that every possible angle has been exhausted by documentarians , another new film emerges with yet another remarkable yet shockingly little-known perspective . 
for all its impressive craftsmanship , and despite an overbearing series of third-act crescendos , lily chou-chou never really builds up a head of emotional steam . 
unlike most anime , whose most ardent fans outside japan seem to be introverted young men with fantasy fetishes , metropolis never seems hopelessly juvenile . 
this is cruel , misanthropic stuff with only weak claims to surrealism and black comedy . 
trailer park magnolia : too long , too cutesy , too sure of its own importance , and possessed of that peculiar tension of being too dense & about nothing at all . 
thoughtless , random , superficial humour and a lot of very bad scouse accents

a great ensemble cast can't lift this heartfelt enterprise out of the familiar . 
what better message than 'love thyself' could young women of any size receive ? 
the exposition does pay off , if you can stay awake that long . there's little gripping in the film until the second hour . 
lan yu seems altogether too slight to be called any kind of masterpiece . it is , however , a completely honest , open-hearted film that should appeal to anyone willing to succumb to it . 
in his role of observer of the scene , lawrence sounds whiny and defensive , as if his life-altering experiences made him bitter and less mature . 
a psychologically rich and suspenseful moral thriller with a stellar performance by al pacino . 
philip k . dick must be turning in his grave , along with my stomach . 
sillier , cuter , and shorter than the first ( as best i remember ) , but still a very good time at the cinema . 
hoffman spends a good deal of screen time alone and without much dialogue , using only his considerable physical skill and screen presence to pull off the role . 
macbeth . mcdonald's . how far apart these poles of popular culture seemed until billy morrissette's sly mcshakespeare crime comedy . 
bielinsky's script is slick and fiendishly clever , with seemingly a twist a minute . 
sadly , 'garth' hasn't progressed as nicely as 'wayne . '
in the pianist , polanski is saying what he has long wanted to say , confronting the roots of his own preoccupations and obsessions , and he allows nothing to get in the way . 
romanek keeps adding flourishes -- artsy fantasy sequences -- that simply feel wrong . they cheapen the overall effect . 
comes off more like a misdemeanor , a flat , unconvincing drama that never catches fire . 
the april 2002 instalment of the american war for independence , complete with loads of cgi and bushels of violence , but not a drop of human blood . 
first , for a movie that tries to be smart , it's kinda dumb . and second , what's with all the shooting ? 
drumline is a movie that treats its characters and audience with respect ; it can't be accused of being a dumbed-down teen comedy . 
whenever it threatens to get bogged down in earnest dramaturgy , a stirring visual sequence like a surge through swirling rapids or a leap from pinnacle to pinnacle rouses us . if horses could fly , this is surely what they'd look like . 
if you're willing to have fun with it , you won't feel cheated by the high infidelity of unfaithful . 
not only a reminder of how they used to make movies , but also how they sometimes still can be made . 
the main story . . . is compelling enough , but it's difficult to shrug off the annoyance of that chatty fish . 
[a] wonderfully loopy tale of love , longing , and voting . 
cannon's confidence and laid-back good spirits are , with the drumming routines , among the film's saving graces . 
winds up being both revelatory and narcissistic , achieving some honest insight into relationships that most high-concept films candy-coat with pat storylines , precious circumstances and beautiful stars . 
culkin turns his character into what is basically an anti-harry potter -- right down to the gryffindor scarf . 
it's not a film to be taken literally on any level , but its focus always appears questionable . 
i suspect this is the kind of production that would have been funnier if the director had released the outtakes theatrically and used the film as a bonus feature on the dvd . 
to my taste , the film's comic characters come perilously close to being amoses and andys for a new generation . 
adam sandler is to gary cooper what a gnat is to a racehorse . 
transcends its agenda to deliver awe-inspiring , at times sublime , visuals and offer a fascinating glimpse into the subculture of extreme athletes whose derring-do puts the x into the games . 
unambitious writing emerges in the movie , using a plot that could have come from an animated-movie screenwriting textbook . 
beautifully shot against the frozen winter landscapes of grenoble and geneva , the film unfolds with all the mounting tension of an expert thriller , until the tragedy beneath it all gradually reveals itself . 
it just goes to show , an intelligent person isn't necessarily an admirable storyteller . 
it's more enjoyable than i expected , though , and that's because the laughs come from fairly basic comedic constructs . cinematic pratfalls given a working over . the cast is spot on and the mood is laid back . 
the character of zigzag is not sufficiently developed to support a film constructed around him . 
the movie is virtually without context -- journalistic or historical . what's worse is that pelosi knows it . 
there's no denying the physically spectacular qualities of the film . . . or the emotional integrity of the performances . 
with youthful high spirits , tautou remains captivating throughout michele's religious and romantic quests , and she is backed by a likable cast . 
despite the surface attractions -- conrad l . hall's cinematography will likely be nominated for an oscar next year -- there's something impressive and yet lacking about everything . 
it's a drawling , slobbering , lovable run-on sentence of a film , a southern gothic with the emotional arc of its raw blues soundtrack . 
alas , the black-and-white archival footage of their act showcases pretty mediocre shtick . 
a movie that hovers somewhere between an acute character study and a trite power struggle . 
gangs , despite the gravity of its subject matter , is often as fun to watch as a good spaghetti western . 
in other words , it's just another sports drama/character study . yet this one makes up for in heart what it lacks in outright newness . plus , like i already mentioned . . . it's robert duvall ! c'mon ! 
woo has as much right to make a huge action sequence as any director , but how long will filmmakers copy the " saving private ryan " battle scenes before realizing steven spielberg got it right the first time ? 
the script isn't very good ; not even someone as gifted as hoffman ( the actor ) can make it work . 
in scope , ambition and accomplishment , children of the century . . . takes kurys' career to a whole new level . 
 . . . too slow , too boring , and occasionally annoying . 
beautifully acted , smart and funny . it steers clear of being a maudlin soap opera normally found on lifetime . 
in comparison to his earlier films it seems a disappointingly thin slice of lower-class london life ; despite the title . . . amounts to surprisingly little . 
a bit of whimsically warped history elevated by the central performance of ian holm . 
it is so refreshing to see robin williams turn 180 degrees from the string of insultingly innocuous and sappy fiascoes he's been making for the last several years . 
a terrific insider look at the star-making machinery of tinseltown . 
it's a celebration of self-confidence and a slap in the face of a society that cherises impossibly unnatural physical perfection . 
the sweetest thing , a romantic comedy with outrageous tendencies , may be a mess in a lot of ways . but it does have one saving grace . a lot of its gags and observations reflect a woman's point-of-view . 
instead of a hyperbolic beat-charged urban western , it's an unpretentious , sociologically pointed slice of life . 
an absurdist comedy about alienation , separation and loss . 
a stunning and overwhelmingly cogent case for kissinger as a calculating war criminal . 
the only camouflage carvey should now be considering is a paper bag to wear over his head when he goes out into public , to avoid being recognized as the man who bilked unsuspecting moviegoers . 
a film that begins with the everyday lives of naval personnel in san diego and ends with scenes so true and heartbreaking that tears welled up in my eyes both times i saw the film . 
malone does have a gift for generating nightmarish images that will be hard to burn out of your brain . but the movie's narrative hook is way too muddled to be an effectively chilling guilty pleasure . 
one regards reign of fire with awe . what a vast enterprise has been marshaled in the service of such a minute idea . 
a profoundly moving document . . . the filmmakers' refusal to downplay the situation's intractability makes the glimmer of hope the film offers that much more powerful . 
the pace and the visuals are so hyped up that a curious sense of menace informs everything . 
a sparkling cosmopolitan comedy that plays fast and loose with sacred cows of family values . 
there are a few laughs and clever sight gags scattered about , but not enough to make this anything more than another big-budget bust . 
an energetic and engaging film that never pretends to be something it isn't . 
[city] reminds us how realistically nuanced a robert de niro performance can be when he is not more lucratively engaged in the shameless self-caricature of 'analyze this' ( 1999 ) and 'analyze that , ' promised ( or threatened ) for later this year . 
not quite as miraculous as its dreamworks makers would have you believe , but it more than adequately fills the eyes and stirs the emotions .

i admired it , particularly that unexpected downer of an ending . 
definitely not the knee-slapper that i was told it would be , but enough hahas for me to grade as passable .

this gorgeous epic is guaranteed to lift the spirits of the whole family . 
presents a most persuasive vision of hell on earth . 
no worse than a lot of the crap we've been offered this summer , and slightly better than men in black 2 as far as slapdash extraterrestrial comedies go .

hoffman's performance is authentic to the core of his being . 
i wish windtalkers had had more faith in the dramatic potential of this true story . this would have been better than the fiction it has concocted , and there still could have been room for the war scenes .

beresford nicely mixes in as much humor as pathos to take us on his sentimental journey of the heart . it really is a shame that more won't get an opportunity to embrace small , sweet 'evelyn . '
a deliberative account of a lifestyle characterized by its surface-obsession � one that typifies the delirium of post , pre , and extant stardom .

savvy director robert j . siegel and his co-writers keep the story subtle and us in suspense .
