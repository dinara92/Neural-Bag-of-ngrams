been there , done that , liked it much better the first time around - when it was called the professional . 
it follows the basic plot trajectory of nearly every schwarzenegger film : someone crosses arnie . arnie blows things up . 
a little judicious editing would have helped a lot , but the talented cast matches the film's ambitions and compensates for its modest budget . 
in all , this is a watchable movie that's not quite the memorable experience it might have been . 
theology aside , why put someone who ultimately doesn't learn at the center of a kids' story ? 
a great looking , trippy adventure . i can't wait for the next one . 
 . . . a hollow joke told by a cinematic gymnast having too much fun embellishing the misanthropic tale to actually engage it . 
 . . . if it had been only half-an-hour long or a tv special , the humor would have been fast and furious-- at ninety minutes , it drags . 
a strong and confident work which works so well for the first 89 minutes , but ends so horrendously confusing in the final two

allen's underestimated charm delivers more goodies than lumps of coal .

it's like every bad idea that's ever gone into an after-school special compiled in one place , minus those daytime programs' slickness and sophistication ( and who knew they even had any ? ) . 
a high-spirited buddy movie about the reunion of berlin anarchists who face arrest 15 years after their crime . 
the problem is that rather than dramatizing this premise , mr . desplechin is content to state it .

the adventure doesn't contain half the excitement of balto , or quarter the fun of toy story 2 .

what could have been a pointed little chiller about the frightening seductiveness of new technology loses faith in its own viability and succumbs to joyless special-effects excess . 
the additional storyline is interesting and entertaining , but it doesn't have the same magical quality as the beginning of the story . i like the new footage and still love the old stuff .

 . . . there is enough originality in 'life' to distance it from the pack of paint-by-number romantic comedies that so often end up on cinema screens . 
the stripped-down dramatic constructs , austere imagery and abstract characters are equal parts poetry and politics , obvious at times but evocative and heartfelt . 
fessenden continues to do interesting work , and it would be nice to see what he could make with a decent budget . but the problem with wendigo , for all its effective moments , isn't really one of resources . 
a haunted , bountiful film that demands patience -- and rewards it . 
the movie's gloomy atmosphere is fascinating , though , even if the movie itself doesn't stand a ghost of a chance . 
it aimlessly and unsuccessfully attempts to fuse at least three dull plots into one good one . 
an authentically vague , but ultimately purposeless , study in total pandemonium . 
visually imaginative , thematically instructive and thoroughly delightful , it takes us on a roller-coaster ride from innocence to experience without even a hint of that typical kiddie-flick sentimentality .
