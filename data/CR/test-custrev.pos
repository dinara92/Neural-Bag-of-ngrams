i have less money invested in the router table and dual routers than i would have if i had purchased a single cheap reliant sharper .
the setup works awesome , as with any tool i look closely at the individual tool for it 's merits , and not just the company as a whole .
i would however highly recommend the m12v router ! .
i 'm not overly fond of green but when i used this hitachi m12v it turns out that now i 'm very fond of it .
the smooth operation variable speed and a set of good masada bits will provide just the right combination for great predictable results .
its well made and user friendly .
you 'll love it ! .
it is currently permanently mounted ( 3 years now ) in my router table and will most likely stay there until its shot .
this router has soft start and runs smooth and true .
i use the router with a 3 1/2in raised panel bit with no problems .
it has enough power to hog out all the material in one pass , but i usually take multiple to prevent blowout and a smoother finish .
for the price , i am considering purchasing a spare just to have as a backup .
you just can 't go wrong with this one ! .
enjoy .
this is an excellent router for the price .
the first one lasted about 6 years of heavy use .
this is a well-made and powerful tool .
the m12v has been great .
the height adjustment works well- not perfect .
the wood can be pushed thru fast or slow with little bog .
what i really like about- its quite , it can handle my workload and it was so cheap that i can throw it away and buy another one without blinking .
i did like the heft of the machine .
the power is incredible , it cut through md and plywood like butter .
the edge guide has a nice micro adjust feature that works well .
i do not count this as a negative , however , because it is not that much of a nuisance and at the price for what you get this router is way too good to pass up ! . ! . ! .
the ones i 've kept ( porter cables , dew alts , bosch , and this hitachi ) have proven their worth over the years , however , when i need a real workhorse , i grab this router .
i recently had to run a 3/4 " straight bit through hard maple to make a deep dado and was amazed that this machine didn 't even slow down .
i could take 1/2 " passes and it still didn 't skip a beat .
i 've yet to find the limitation for this hitachi ( my only hitachi tool , by the way ) and quite frankly , i don 't know that i have the muscle to push this machine any harder .
bottom line is that at $160 , this is an absolute steal .
i 've got a buddy who 's trying to offload his almost new $300 systematic because he saw what this router can do .
it is without even a slight doubt , my new favorite .
the hitachi m12v is a dream to work with , smooth starts , adjustable speeds , micro-adjustable depth , and plenty of power to spare .
i couldn 't believe what i had been missing .
if you 're looking for a 3hp plunge router , the hitachi m12v is your best bet to stretch your equipment budget .
i 'll be getting a second one for my router table ! .
i have been impressed with the power of the hitachi m12v .
it doesn 't bog down under load .
cuts are easy and smooth .
i use it on a router table , and it is works well .
other than this , i am very pleased with the router and would buy it again .
i really liked the price . . .
i like the speed control .
it has plenty of power .
all in all i am pleased with the router .
the power , low noise operation , and speed control makes up for the problems i have experienced .
overall it is a great value .
for the price i don 't think you can beat it .
this is a fantastic tool to use .
this is a quality product , not to be confused with the cheap junk that hitachi gets manufactured in china .
when the router is working it is a very nice machine for the money .
but , for the money it is a good machine .
for the hobbiest , it 's probably a nice buy .
for the person that uses the equipment every day , pay the extra and get a reliable & safer unit .
this router does everything that it is supposed to do , so i dont really know how to talk that bad about it .
it was a very quick setup and installation , in fact the disc that it comes with pretty much makes sure you cant mess it up .
by no means do you have to be a tech junkie to be able to install it , just be able to put a cd in the computer and it tells you what to do .
it works great , i am usually at the full 54 mbps , although every now and then that drops to around 36 mbps only because i am 2 floors below where the router is .
it really is a great buy if you are loo kin at having just one modem but many computers around the house .
there are 3 computers in my house all getting wireless connection from this router , and everybody is happy with it .
its the easiest thing to setup i thought , and i am only 16 . . . so with all that said , buy the router ! . ! . ! . ! .
i recently bought the linksys wrt54g router and have been very happy with the router itself .
but the product is elf is great .
once you set it up , it 's great .
and it is extremely well-priced for what you 're getting .
another 5 star performance .
this setup using the cd was about as easy as learning how to open a refrigerator door for the first time .
pertaining to the speed issue : i got 54mps while i was in the same room .
this router works at 54mbps that 's megabyte not kilobyte .
i hooked the linksys wireless router up to a broadband connection which is running at a maximum of 700 plus kilobytes on the download e ! .
broadband hooked up to this wireless setup flies .
installation was as near automatic as can be .
all in all this is a 5 star piece of equipment .
even during the firmware updates my roommates did not loose wireless connectivity .
new firmware update allows for automatic wireless network configuration .
all you have to do is click one button on the router configuration window and the router automatically senses the devices and configures the network .
awesome for the newbie , though i personally like to fasten every bolt myself .
comes with a installation cd which instructs you step by step to setting up the router .
you need to know absolutely nothing about setting up the network .
the router works fine for both wired and wireless .
i can go pretty far away from my router and still connect wirelessly .
overall , if you know what basic steps to take , it was not difficult to connect , and the s/w worked well to connect .
i 'd give it 4 . 5 stars if possible , but since 5 stars would be misleading , i give it 4 stars .
i have had mine for about a year and use a third party firmware on mine and love it .
just want a wireless router for home or your very small business , you can just get a wrt54g from here and configure it .
i would highly recommend that you do this if you want to learn something , but if you are not interested in learning this stuff and just want a working wireless router , just get the wrt54g .
yes , the 1-800 number probably redirected me to someone in india , but the guy was easy to understand , and he helped solve the problem .
it 'll make life a lot easier , and preclude you from having to give this product a negative review .
this is my fourth linksys product and , aside from the rough start , i 'm very satisfied with this router .
this linksys router does it for the right price .
the range is terrific , i am using this for my home and i was transferring at 50+mbs from my backyard .
i 've since gotten the linksys modem ( befcmu10 ) and stacked it with the wrt54g router and it works fantastic ! . ! . ! .
it took me about an hour to set up a wireless environment in her townhouse and she hasn 't called me yet with any problems .
there are instructions to encrypt your personal wireless network so no one else can end up hogging/stealing your bandwidth .
and the tech writers have made the installation process so easy for people lick my aunt to follow .
a very well made product that has worked very well for me over the years .
i upgraded from an older 801 . 11b router to the linksys wrt54g for its improved security , and of course , speed .
as i mentioned in my first paragraph , it supports wpa security , which is far superior to wep .
in addition it is very easy to setup .
anted to rate the router higher than 1 star , due to its security , easy of use , etc .
so far it all works fine with either cable or wireless connections .
the setup was very easy .
just follow the instructions carefully , it 's all based on a cd that has everything you need to get you up and running in no time .
the dual antenna is a plus and the design is slick .
drops and strong signals even from the backyard .
the wrt54g offers excellent security features and much more ( and easier ) configuration menu that i didn 't even need a manual to setup correctly .
even though you could get a cheap router these days , i 'm happy i spent a little extra for the linksys .
the quality is significant and you 'll be very happy from saving time and the headache .
i got it working fast enough .
it is a nice router in all ways but one .
i also wanted to switch to broad com hardware ( which the linksys uses ) because my wifi menisci card in my dell laptop with lucien silicon in it used 70% of my 1 . 2ghz laptop 's cpu when using the wireless at full speed .
however , setting up using the quick start instructions was a breeze .
it 's easy to install the security on this product but linksys doesn 't do a good job of explaining why its important .
while i am not happy that a solid state device died after such a short period of time , my quick review of this product space did not yield any other brands that seem much better than linksys .
the new router came with an updated setup utility that makes getting the router installed a fairly straight forward process .
unlike other reviewers , i have found the support to be responsive , almost no wait time on the phone , and relatively knowledgeable .
overall , this router seems like a reasonably priced product th ! .
at works as well as can be expected for products in this space and the company backs it up with good support .
it 's easy and really works , with some incredible range .
compatibility with other devices is excellent too ; . i 've only found one 11b device that won 't work with its mixed mode ( and it won 't work with *anyone 's* mixed mode ) .
setup in xp was instant and intuitive .
the main advantage of this system over its predecessor is the ability to open a wider pipeline between clients .
linksys quality and tech support have been outstanding .
my experience with installation was quite good .
i upgraded both my card and router and really had no problems with installation on my sony vaio laptop ( xp operating system ) .
the card basically installed itself and the " install wizard " on the cd that came with the router basically set the router up to work with one computer ( with the 54g card ) and also a second computer in my house ( with an 11b card ) .
i haven 't tried to set up any advanced features on the router , but it is not difficult to set up for basic use .
the documentation is much better than the documentation that came with the 11b router -- i needed a lot of help from linksys technical assistance to set that one up .
i like this router a whole lot better the linksys 11b router it replaced -- the signal strength seems ot be much strainers , seldom falling below the " very good " range ( and most often excellent within 25-50 feet of the router .
the transmission speed is also quite good , with pages loading very quickly .
i have had no problem either with backward compatibility , in that the " mixed mode " feature lets you both 54 and 11 mb cards off the router .
as far as dealing with network access of other computers this router is pretty good given the price- remember this router is the same one that was released right when the g standard was introduced to the market .
all in all , it 's a good router if you don 't have the cash for a speed booster one .
i just replaced my old linksys router with this one , turned everything on in the right order , and it was up and running with no problems .
all of the wireless components that i bought were a breeze to set up as well .
this product is by far the best broadband router on the market , i bought this to replace one of those linksys instant wireless b routers , worked great for about a year .
my op ion is concentrate on what you need now , this product has excellent range , holds a teddy connection , ha sent even drooped one and i have it for more than a month now .
if you need a wireless router . . . . get it get it get it . . . . works really good . . . .
i was an early purchaser of the wrt54g , and had a few problems with stability and speed - finally , the march 03 firmware update has resulted in an excellent product ! .
i just upgraded to the linksys wrt54g wireless-g router last month and i am very happy with the quality of the product .
this router acts as a wireless access point , 100 mb switch and a router making it a nice multipurpose device .
the in ital setup of the router was simple .
works pretty well .
the best part about this router is now i have a dhaka server .
my brother had an old linksys b band wireless router in his home and it was like magic .
well linksys was one of the original big players in the router industry .
yin to point out they have experience , and so the reliability of the connection you get is among the best .
this model appears to be especially good .
the darn thing works as promised and it 's amazingly cheap too .
if you want to work wirelessly , this router does just what you want it to do and my geek friends say that the security is as good as it gets right now .
the setup was a breeze , i had some reservations about a wireless network ( see my review for linksys wet11 ) but this item was on sale as well as the wet11 so i just had to splurge .
to set up the box , wap , and ether nest bridge , with the encryption on was less then 30 mins .
the setup software did everything .
in a week of use i 've never had to reboot the router .
a decent piece of hardware with great speed ( i get the same speeds as with my comp connected directly to the modem ) and good signal quality .
i guess the two antennae help with that besides making it look cooler .
i am getting better speeds on all my web programs .
there seem to be fewer collisions and dropped packets as i read from the router logs than with my old dlink router .
it works well with my vip adapter , which is also a linksys .
pros . 1 . speed 2 . signal strength 3 . advanced configuration options
purchased this router a few months back , no problems whatsoever .
in fact , it supports the new wpa encryption standard , which is way better than wep .
works perfectly with my netgear wireless paramecia .
feature wise , its a lot better than the dlink and netgear routers out there .
reset the network , tried the connection , and it 's working like a charm .
however since this router is backward compatible , that doesn 't pose a problem at all .
overall , it 'll make my move that much easier knowing i don 't have to worry about connectivity .
for more than a year , and it is totally reliable .
no down time , great signal strength .
there is an open-source firmware on the net which has tons of extra features .
setup is totally breeze and linksys 's web site is pretty easy to navigate .
the fact that has an open-source firmware makes it a great option in my opinion .
so the pretty solid router all around good for the money here 's the link to firmware updates http : //www . suavest . com/forum6 . html
absolutely no problems with this router .
i downloaded and updated the firmware , and followed the easy setup instructions .
a call to customer support ( got to a live person within a couple of minutes ) helped me tweak a couple of the settings to streamline performance .
speed is not a problem .
after upgrading the drivers and firmware a few times and e-mailing tech support for some setting tips it now works fine .
as far as linksys goes , i have used several of their products and they seem to hold up well - no problems .
getting the router setup in a " vanilla " configuration that works for 99% of users was very easy , and i was able to do this no problem .
second , the setup cd actually worked perfectly .
i still need to read up on some of the security settings , etc to fully understand all that 's up there , but bottom-line is that the installation was like night and day compared to the speed boost router .
when i saw a high gain ( low price ) antenna was available to the wrt54g router , i thought i 'd happily give up some ( practically unattainable anyway , since you 've got to be in spitting distance from the router ) speed in favor of wider coverage .
having done all this , i was quite pleased to see that all corners i needed were decently covered by the signal .
the box is upstairs , and in the farthest room i get connected at 11-18m speed - that is similar to the older 10m ethernet standard .
apart from speed , the signal is consistent and works without interruptions , etc .
the wrt54g plus the hga7t is a perfect solution if you need wireless coverage in a wider area or for a hard-walled house as was my case .
all of this said [as it 's on it 's way back to amazon] , the one song it did include provided far better sound than the ipod .
the base was deeper and the highs were crisper .
what a kick butt mp3 machine and the freedom to get songs from a reasonable source , instead of paying for them two or three times , then get the creative zen ipod killer , kiss my ass itunes ! .
the sound is great , the portability , etc . . . all the " stuff " you expect from a good mp-3 player , this zen micro has it .
) one outstanding positive feature is the battery . it holds a charge for a long time , longer than most other similar products and the user can replace it easily or take another along as a backup .
creative did well on its rechargeable battery feature . .
the zen micro fm receiver is ok , not great .
) the zen micro appears sturdy and well constructed , hefty , if you will , far better than many of its competitors . .
well , i have an ipod mini - and i really like it , but all in all , i like the zen micro more .
smaller size , 1 gb of more space , radio , voice recording , removable battery , cooler look , all in one .
i love how small the thing is , and the blue glow - i 've had it for two weeks with no electronic problems at all .
creative media source is very easy to use once you get the hang of it , and the file transfers are fast .
sound quality is great , fm tuner is fine , as is the recorder .
this is the mp3 player with everything i need . as long as it lasts me a good three years , i 'm satisfied .
also if you want a device that does so much more than the ipod mini but is at the same price , this is the player for you .
upon opening the box i was confronted with this small cute little mp3 player .
the software included is an easy installation and you have the option of using the creative software , windows media player 10 , or simply windows explorer to move music back and forth between your zen touch .
the package also comes with a usb cable , an ac adapter , a pair of headphones ( they 're okay until you get a better pair ) , a stand , and a microfiber pouch to carry your zen touch in .
overall i 'm incredibly impressed with my new zen touch .
it 's cute as anything and the glowing blue led looks super cool around the edges .
for the price i think this is a remarkably fun mp3 player .
i 've had this player for more than 4 months and i 'm very happy with it .
1 speakers at home , i rarely use it with the earbuds , though they are much better than the ones you normally get with other mp3 players .
the look & feel : i have the black one and the contrasting neon blue on the buttons add a very nice ambiance .
it feels tiny in the hand without it .
the stand that comes with it is very useful to prop it up on the desk .
the blue backlit lcd looks really neat and is easy to read .
the touch buttons are textured so that your finger sdon 't slip which was very thoughtful .
reliability & build i dropped the player once from about 4 ft , and it fell hard , but kept on playing .
the hard case they give with it must work well .
it feels solid and not flimsy like the carbon .
sound i 'm no audiophile but i was amazed by the clarity the player had , it was much better than the sound card on my computer and louder too .
i have had the ipod mini and it performs on the level with my sound card but the micro beats it outright .
best of all the wmas ( i have a lot of them ) sound great .
utility its got a huge list of features including an fm recorder a calender and contacts list .
the songs recorded with fm are as good as the original signal .
creating and modifying playlists is easy and clean .
i think that for its price compared to the ipod the creative zen is pretty good .
the good news is that the creative support is very responsive and after some emails and postal exchanges , i had a new zen .
the sound is quite good , in terms of volume .
i didnt have any installation problems ; . and the touch pad is fine , even if it is sort of inaccurate .
i didnt get ipod because i dont especially like itunes ( no music i want , but thats just me ) and the creative product was cheaper ; . and i needed to be able to use wma files .
all-in-all , its good enough for its price as long as it doesnt break again due to normal use .
the battery is removable .
fm radio built in ( howard stern ) .
record memos using the built in microphone .
the player looks so much better when you 're actually holding it .
the back of the player is nice too , with water ripples inside the clear white coating .
you can use it as a storage hard drive .
i have no problem using itunes with the zen micro ( in a makeshift sorta way ) .
however , if there was one thing i liked about the creative , it would be the car adapter .
while they all seem to have their own positives and negatives , i picked the zen micro over the ipod mini , because i am not an apple person , never has been - i wanted something that is fully compatible with windows media player .
also , the wma compression format is superior to mp3 , especially at lower bit rates , so i needed a player that could handle wma and integrate well with my windows xp computers .
i was fortunate to get the packaging that still included all the accessories ( desk stand/hard case , belt clip , wall charger , etc ) .
and so far , i have been very , very happy with my zen micro .
it 's being used daily and i have had none of the problems reported by other reviewers ( headphone jack , player locking up , etc ) .
the micro has an impressive array of very nice features and a well designed user interface .
what i like the most : - small and solid feel .
the zen micro is smaller than it looks in pictures , and feels very solid .
the blue backlight is pretty cool .
the screen is clear and readable , and the touch pad works very well , it took me less than a day to get the hang of it , and now i like it better than having to click buttons or fiddle with a separate volume control .
- great sound ! . i was very impressed , i encode at 192 kbps and the audio quality is great , especially with the better headphones .
the first thing i did was upgrade the firmware to the version required for wmp10 , it syncs flawlessly with media player and transfers are fast .
- replaceable battery .
with the right firmware , drag and drop to and from the player like any other jump drive .
i have not yet used all the features , like the calendar , etc , but as a music player this little thing rocks .
if you can get one with all the accessories and a cheap extended warranty , this is the player to get ! . highly recommended .
the micro seemed like an ipod for less .
pros : - excellent sound , even with the headphones that come out of the box , but it absolutely rocked with my bose quiet comfort 2 set .
- looks sleek , compact , has a radio .
don 't worry this player rocks .
it was also the most appealing .
for the zen creative focused on packaging which looked well thought out , well presented and easy to open and put back together .
it has a cardboard slip cover with a nice layered box casing inside .
a distinct ipod relation is evident with white colored cables , power plug and the very nice zen case with a white rubber inside covering .
i do give create to creative for their attractive design .
creative has put a lot of effort into making this player appeal to those true geeks that search for coolness and functionality in electronic devices .
creative was defiantly giving the ipod a run for their money with this device .
it makes the nomad i purchase feel and look like junk .
everything shines of quality .
i was more excited about this player upon opening than i was about the nomad .
i am now staring at an array of stuff including zen micro player , stereo earbud headphones , a rechargeable lithium-ion battery , an ac/dc power adapter , a usb 2 . 0 cable , a belt-clip , a stand , a stylish cloth pouch , an installation cd , a quick-start guide , and creative mediasource software .
the interface works great .
i enjoy getting use to the touch pad .
in minutes i was easily navigating through the menus .
what impressed me most was the sound .
at 128 the songs sound very good .
the zen lives up to the audio quality i love and expect .
the earbuds are great headphones as good as my ak studio 240 , well not as good but darn close .
the zen was an impressive purchase and i would highly recommend it to anyone using napster .
i absolutely love it .
it 's so small .
it looks sleek and modern .
it holds plenty of songs .
the sound is amazing .
the menu is easy to use and understand .
i love the touchpaper controls .
they 're easy to use .
the radio and voice recording are nice .
the earbud headphones are really nice .
the battery has a long life .
it 's rechargable and supposedly easy to replace though i haven 't had to do it yet of course .
the file ripping/transfering software that comes with the player is easy to use .
it 's faster than wmp .
so far i have no complaints with this player .
if anyone is thinking of getting an ipod mini , forget it and go with this player .
it 's cheaper , holds more songs and is smaller .
i have stored 40 audio cds and i still have close to 2 . 8 gb free .
user interface : the software is simple and straight forward .
you can use the player to store your computer data files ( good feature to have ) .
battery : a big big plus .
most of the other players i checked dont have user serviceable battery .
each battery lasts about 10-11 hours .
another good feature is that you can charge the battery by just connecting the player to your computer using the usb cable .
fm tuner & microphone : having a tuner in the player is a blessing .
built in microphone is great for recording short voice notes .
sound : this is where i love zen the most .
excellent sound i mean the player has juice .
the bass treble the sound detail is aw some .
i compared it to other cd players ( two models of panasonic , rio & samsung ) and they were no way even near zen micro .
looks and shape : i have a black one and the first time i charged it and switched it on jeez the blue light looked so cool .
its compact and has rounded edges .
fits well in hand in trouser pockets .
freebies you get : a cradle with detachable stand and belt clip , some thing very handy and useful .
fm transmitter ( belkin has a good one ) to use zen with your car stereo fm tuner latest find : connected this baby to my $3800 audiophile audio system and it produced clean sound compared to ipod .
thankfully , creative has come through with a product that puts the ipod back in its place .
while i have not had the " privilege " , as many call it , of owning an ipod , based on the experience of friends who have had some misfortune with their ipod ( and subsequently purchased the zen touch or zen micro ) , i can pretty much rest assured that my decision to purchase the zen micro was one of the more informed ones .
by focusing exclusively on quality rather than excessive marketing , they have introduced a player that can look the ipod straight in the eye and not flinch .
while i 'm not too keen on their customer service ( none of the products i have from creative have given me issues ) , i can definitely recommend the zen micro for the simple fact that it does exactly what it is supposed to do and more . . . without needing any of the extra hype except word of mouth .
about the product : the zen micro is a sleek , stylish device that caters not just to " hip " youngsters but to people of all walks of life who like to listen on the go without having to worry frequently about battery life , size , or the " awkward " factor .
it fits comfortably in my shirt pocket and while very well-designed , doesn 't look to ostentatious while i 'm walking around with it .
the interface , while a bit confusing at first , is very easy to navigate after about 15 minutes .
battery life is exceptional , lasting longer than the 8-10 hours that seem reasonable with most music players on the market .
transferring files couldn 't be easier thanks to the included software bundle .
also , i am quite partial to the creative mediasource organizer and player software , which i had with audigy zs sound card originally ; . it is definitely an added plus .
all-in-all , creative has definitely come up with a winner in terms of product design and features , and i look forward to the nomad/zen line of products seizing more market share as people begin to realize that quality is a better determinant of experience than quantity and hype .
initially , i was very impressed , after loading 180 songs it seemed to function very well but then it would lock up on me and a battery removal remedied this , i then downloaded the upgrades and everything seemed to be alright .
the extra gb of hard rive space , remove able battery and fm tuner , as well as the fact that i was previously a satisfied owner of the nomad ii put it over the top for me .
fortunately for me , i have yet to have a single problem with this player .
i think the os and controls are very well thought out and although i 'll admit i was a bit intimidated during my first few hours with the micro , the interface and controls became second nature after the first day or so .
however , there is a more detailed pdf manual on the cd ( and online ) that should answer any questions about the operational features of the zen micro .
as opposed to the nomad ii or any other flash based player , the songs load extremely fast . . . about one or two seconds per song .
i also like the fact that you can edit your mp3 titles , etc .
after comparing the included creative earbuds directly against my sony md-e828lp 's and sennheiser mx-400 's , i find myself still using the creative 's , which in my opinion , sound every bit as good and have a slightly longer cord .
perhaps i bought the micro to be different , the cheaper price tag ( from amazon ) , the design , or avoiding the high ipod theft in nyc subways .
whichever it may be , i 'm happy i 've made this purchase .
when i opened the box , i was shocked by the size of this thing . . . it 's tiny ! .
it 's shorter , sleeker , more compact and fits comfortably in my small hand than the ipod . . . my nokia cell phone towers over this bad boy ! .
the interface has a sassier flair and the blue-lit trimming is an added bonus .
moving on to sound department . . . it delivers ! .
there are extra features packed inside this unit ( some that most will hardly ever use ) such as fm radio tuner , voice recorder , calendar , and alarm clock .
speaking of battery , it 's removable and replaceable ! .
overall , the micro is a solid device and i haven 't fell into a problem with it yet *knocks on wood* .
transferring music is a breeze . i don 't subscribe to music services , but as mentioned on other reviews , micro allows you to subscribe to services other than itunes .
it may not top the ipod mini , but it 's definitely an alternative if you also want the extra features and good sound quality .
strong points : - design : small , comfortable , curved , and stylish .
colors : 10 variety of hot colors made it difficult to choose from .
you don 't need to cough up an extra couple bucks for a " special edition " to get black ! . - sound : awesome ! . - batteries : removable/replaceable .
- audio formats : supports both mp3 , wma . . . and yeah , wav too .
you do get 1 more gb than an ipod mini .
this product is amazing and better than the ipod you can get at the same price .
the 4g ipod costs the same as this 5g zen micro .
it also has a voice recorder and fm radio that you can only get on an ipod if you but an adapter seperately .
creative did an awesome job with the design .
the headphones have great sound and durability and mine came with some extras when i bought it ( a stand , a belt hook , charger ) that i know doesn 't come with every one .
i have the black one and adore it .
it looks nice and sleek and the blue background light looks awesome against the black .
i bought my zen micro three months ago mainly because i preferred the size and style to the ipod mini .
overall , i 've been very impressed with the player .
i 've had almost no problems with the firmware ( ie , lock-ups , shut-downs etc ) , but i have kept the player up to date .
i 'm not sure whether this is related to the charge cycle of its li-ion battery , the better firmware , or a combination of both factors .
i imagine if i left my player untouched ( no backlight ) it could play for considerably more than 12 hours at a low volume level .
one of my favorite features about the player is its ability to sync to windows media player .
its just as fast as the included creative software , but much less invasive , and overall better looking .
the touchpad is great once you get used to it , and i much prefer it to standard buttons or scroll wheels ( as on the dell dj for example ) .
they are sensitive and accurate ( perhaps too accurate , it senses through t-shirt cloth , but the touchpad can be locked ) , but easy to clean , unlike buttons .
also , the touchpad seems to be waterproof to some degree .
its ability to record radio is useful as well , but would have been more so if it could be preset .
the player looks great , feels great , and sounds great .
so far it has been very durable ( other than the little pads on the earbuds ) , but those aren 't really necessary as i find them comfortable on their own .
they also sound excellent compared to other earbuds including retail sets like panasonic's and sennheisers .
i 've dropped the device several times onto hard surfaces , and it still works flawlessly .
this year , it seems that i choose my timing perfectly , having discovered the awesome device that is the zen micro .
everything that i have listed above , the zen has , and more .
the menus are easy to scroll through ; . they are laid out naturally , and make sense .
the computer interface is 90% good , only losing points due to the fact that " creative " branding is all over the place within it .
songs transfer lightning fast , and the two batteries that came in my box give me 24 hours of listen time .
on the fly play list creation , address book , removable storage drive capabilities , sound recorder , the list goes on people , this thing is literally so chalked full of goodies , it was like halloween all over again .
so far i have used all of the above-mentioned features , and find them well designed , and easy to understand .
that 's it for now , what are you doing still reading this , click the " add to cart " button already ! .
right out of the box , i loved it , better features than the ipod , great sound quality and no limitations on what music sources i can use .
so , i was one who was ready to give it 5 stars with no complaints at all .
original review december 2004 i 'm sorry to read about other people having problems with their zen micro , but mine has worked great ! .
this is my first mp3 player and i am so impressed with what such a small device can do .
i have ripped over 100 songs from my cd collection and it was so easy and fast , and they all sound great .
i love that you can create custom playlists , and organize music in so many different ways .
i love my dark blue zen micro and would definitely recommend it .
the fm tuner , the 5g of storage , and the removable disk are all great features .
the fit and finish of the product is first-rate .
overall , i am very pleased with it .
the more i use it and figure out how to do things , the more i like it .
before you run out and buy an ipod , understand something : there are reasons the zen is worth encountering this kind of hassle , principally excellent ( for mp3 ) sound quality .
the supplied headphones are hands-down better than the mediocre ipod buds .
the player is smaller than you think .
bottom line : if you value excellent sound quality and the ability to use music subscription services , and are willing to deal with the possibility ( not the certainty ) of setup gremlins , by all means get the zen micro .
the zen micro is near perfect .
it 's still alive , still kicking , and still playing .
the zen micro ( mine 's black ) has a lot going for it .
it fits into a hand well , it has a removable battery ( this is important ) , great sound quality , fm stereo , recorder , smooth ui , and a feature that most uni pods lack . . . char ! .
the accessories that come with the player are great .
white earbuds ( i replaced those with some shire headphones , big difference ) , a case , a stand , a clip ( which doesn 't really work ) , and a nice little zen micro bag .
best in class .
it gives you the most bang for your buck , period .
creative has been making computer sound equipment for decades and with the zen micro it finally has something with enough quality and , yes , charm to win a nice size of the digital player pie .
pick your favorite color and buy it .
pros the design is very nice , and the colors are too .
it also has tons more features then previous creative products , and most of them are very useful such as the ability to customize the main menu to show the stuff you want , not the default items ( creative labs . com for more on that ) .
the battery is also convenient , but could have been better , such as the zen touch 's battery ( but at least this one is removable ) .
if you don 't mind all the buttons being touch sensitive , i 'd re comment buying it to try out , and also buy an extra 2 year warranty for it ( there are some offered here , for about $15 dollars i think ) .
anyway , my wife got this for me for my birthday and i love the thing .
the program is called nomad and works great for me and seems to cover all the features the included windows software does .
+looks snazzy +smaller than a pack of smokes - easily transported +ac charger included as well as a hard shell that comes with a clip and a stand adapter +usb cable ! .
+battery life is awesome if you upgrade the firmware [requires a windows pc] or make sure to always plug the ac adapter into the player before plugging into the outlet +awesome sound quality . . . i mean it is creative right ? .
+sorts music by artist , album , genre , etc . . . it 's easy to wade through 5 gigs of tunes to find what you 're looking for .
but since it 's so small , it isn 't a big deal to bring it with me .
overall though , i 'm very happy with it and highly recommend it to folks looking for a mp3 player , even if it is to pretend your not a brain dead consumer giving into the marketing hype of the ipod . ; . )
i finally decided to purchase this player because it was compatible with napster 2 go . . . . which is a subscription service , allowing me to download as much music as i want for a $14 . 95 flat fee .
and i must say . . . this mp3 is very cool .
it 's so cute . . . and behind the black panel it glows in a neon blue .
after installation , which was very simple . . . . i downloaded any updated software from the creative website , before i downloaded any music .
the sound is very nice .
i also like the lock feature , so it makes the touch pad inactive .
otherwise , i am extremely please with the creative zen micro 5gb mp3 player .
however after playing with it for three weeks now , i 'm convinced , the zen micro is superior .
i think sound quality should be the first and foremost feature , and the zen is leaps and bounds better in sound quality , with no need to upgrade the earphones .
i thought the fm radio would not see much use with so many tracks available to me , but its great for tuning in to tv programs at the gym while on the treadmill , concerts and programs being simulcast , npr , and on and on .
mine is as easy to use as the mini without any firmware download .
its also smaller , and gets more looks .
an extra gig of room , fm radio , voice recorder , pim applications with sync to outlook .
this is really a no brain er .
i purchased this over the ipod mini because it had several nice features : extra 1g storage , wma support , replaceable battery , and especially that it wasn 't an apple product with their proprietary architecture .
better for the zen micro is outlook compatibility .
creative has excellent music software , a very responsive tech support group ( they are quick on firmware updates , and make them publicly available ) , and usually a good array of accessories .
the zen micro is no exception : in addition to the case , it comes with a neck strap , and has all of the necessary cables for syncing and charging .
the extra spare battery is just a neat bonus .
if i could , i 'd trade-up on my creative muvo2 and snag a zen micro tomorrow .
this is a perfect blend to accomplish both tasks .
i also own a retail store and this little guy easily plugs into my aux slot in the store 's sound system .
feature for feature , i find it a very sweet little player ; . equipped with a higher end headphone system , between this and th larger zen hardly use my home stereo system anymore .
on the whole , i 'm quite happy with the purchase .
the sound is bright and clear , the ability to store any mp3 's ( and not just apple-approved files ) is great , and i plan to make use of the storage space and sound recording from time to time .
the device looks very cool , i think ( exactly as the photos promise ) , it 's comfortable and lightweight in my jacket pocket , and the interface and controls are easy enough to navigate after a bit of practice .
no offense to amazon , but i was able to find one online for just over 200 bucks ( i 'm sure prices here will continue to sink ) , and that also seemed quite a good bargain for the amount of storage space .
i like some local stations , stern , and npr , and so the radio seemed like a great option .
have not had any issues with the headphones or fragility .
as i said , i don 't regret the purchase at all .
ball metaphor : i was hoping creative hit a home run here , and i think the zen micro is more like a stand-up double .
actually , the creative zen micro solves all that .
sound quality ? . phenomenal .
unarguably better than apple 's , and nice earbuds to boot .
your choice of ten colors in a beatiful package .
five gigabytes is plenty for my great albums .
tough as nails .
no skips , and it hasn 't faltered once ( despite your inevitable drop or two .
flawless .
) no locked-in proprietary business like apple ; . this baby plays wmas too .
the voice recorder is a beautiful add-on ; . not even necessary , but just an example of why apple just wants your money and creative labs wants to make a better player .
gets nice sound too .
the fm tuner is just a little spare icing on the cake .
in conclusion , this player is beautiful .
power for the tech-savvy , ease of use for the less fortunate .
but it ; . you won 't regret it .
this player is absolutely phenomenal , i haven 't had any problems , and if you 're worried you will have problems , i suggest buying it at a retail store that has a good return policy but anyways . . . i find the touch pad very easy to use , and i 'm surprised so many people have had problems .
the sound quality is superb , much better than that of an ipod , in my opinion .
the radio works excellent in my area , i 'm not sure everywhere else .
the software is very easy to use , and the transfer is super fast ! .
i 'm not gonna go into the features cause if you 're reading this review , you 've probably already looked at them , but i must say the dj feature if very cool and the removable battery is also a bonus ! .
the blue light also makes this player one of the most fashionable in the market also .
t simply the best player on the market for a really low price , so why look anywhere else ? .
i 've had it for about a week now and have to say it 's one of the best purchases i 've ever made .
it 's a great looking , easy-to-use device but it 's the sound quality which is truly amazing -- far better than my sony mini-disc player .
i have no problems with the touch pad ( once the sensitivity is set to low ) and the interface is a breeze to use without even looking at the pdf manual .
why bother when it works perfectly with media player 10 ? .
the extra gb is just a bonus .
if your looking for a great sounding mini player , you can 't go wrong with the zen micro .
it was a good player when it worked and i loved the design .
the creative zen micro , at first glance , is a dream come true for all mp3 and music lovers .
the zen offered a great alternative .
it 's easy to use , and makes transfering your cd collection to the player a cinch .
the clarity is unbelievable , which means you can cram almost the full 2 , 5 ! .
other mp3 players won 't give you the sonic clarity of the zen at this compression level , so i imagine they won 't at lower ones , either .
transfering mp3s are a cinch with the included software .
the zen plays mp3 , wma and wave formats , which makes it more versatile than the ipod .
the greatest thing about the software ( in my humble ) is that it reads your cd info .
track # , name , artist , album and genre is automatically-retrieved via internet-labeled , and properly categorized into the zen .
ks almost without fail , no matter what your taste in music is : from relaxation music to hard rock , to hip hop , to korean and japanese , to afro-cuban and salsa , jazz , blues , country and pop , this feature performs well .
oh , and another is the cool " halo " light that surrounds the touch pad , and light 's up when you touch the screen , and how the light glows when the zen is connected to the computer .
one : it 's size : it 's smaller than the ipod mini , and holds more music ( 5gb to the ipod mini 's 4gbs ) .
two : it has a removeable/rechargeable battery , so you don 't have to send the thing in when the re ! .
this player is fantastic in terms of audio quality , ease of use , and features .
otherwise , this is a great " alternative " mp3 player for those of use who don 't want to worship the mighty all-powerful apple .
i got it to use with the new $5-per-month service from yahoo ( music unlimited , ) and despite the above issues , i love it .
i have owned some kind of creative audio product since 1993 and have never had to call tech support .
the main issue now is that this new zen micro seems to be the best on the market at least temporarily .
it beats apple on the storage space , it beats apple on the removable battery ( and batter life ) , and i personally like its interface more than the ipod scroll wheel .
further , the tech specs suggest that it has better audio quality than the ipod .
i have had several mp3 players over the past few years , and have to say that this by far is the best that i 've owned .
however , the ipod does not come close to the number of extra features that the 'zen micro ' has to offer .
some features that the 'zen micro ' has that sold me on my purchase include : a 5g hard drive . . . actually an sd flash card drive . . . very large and much more than actually needed , the ability to sync with microsoft outlook 's calendar , the long battery life of about 10 to 12 hours ( i can change the battery myself for about $40 to buy vs .
sending the unit to the company of purchase which costs about $90 ) , the ability to record with a built-in microphone ( great for recording reminders and meetings ) , very sturdy construction , and not to mention . . . the sound quality is excellent ! .
as far as user interface is concerned , the best and easiest to use seems to be the one that comes with the player , 'creative mediasource organizer ' .
this program enables the user to batch convert and convert audio files from one format to another .
these include : mp3 , wave , wma , wma pro , and wma loss less ; . it is very user-friendly simply by right-clicking the file ( s ) to be converted .
by far this seems to be the best value out there for the money ; . if you are undecided , the creative zen micro seems to be the best choice .
when it 's working , it 's great but it is very temper mental .
this camera is perfect for an enthusiastic amateur photographer .
the pictures are razor-sharp , even in macro .
it is small enough to fit easily in a coat pocket or purse .
it is light enough to carry around all day without bother .
operating its many features is easy and often obvious - i 'm no annie levitt's , but i was able to figure out most of its abilities just messing around with it at a camera store .
the manual does a fine job filling in any blanks that remain .
the auto-focus performs well , but i love having the 12 optional scene modes - they are dummy-proof , and correspond to many situations in which i would actually seek to use the camera .
comes with a 16 mb compact flash and one rechargable battery the charging unit , included , is fast and small .
i enthusiastically recommend this camera .
it 's easy to use , and yet very feature rich .
in the auto mode it functions basically as a point and click , the scene modes are very easy to use and produce good results .
the manual mode is feature rich and i can 't wait to get the hang of it .
the macro mode is exceptional , the pictures are very clear and you can take the pictures with the lens unbelievably close the subject .
the battery life is very good , i got about 90 minutes with the lcd turned on all the time , the first time around , and i have been using it with the lcd off every now and then , and have yet needed to recharge it .
i fell in love with this camera , it combines ease of use , with an immense amount of options and power .
this camera is ideal for people who want more power , but do n 't want to spend 1000s dollars on a camera .
with nikon , although picture qualities are as good as any other 4 mp cameras , i 've had the following headaches ; .
but overall this is a good camera with a ' really good ' picture clarity ; . an exceptional close-up shooting capability .
otherwise , it takes very good pictures ; . shutter delay is n 't so bad either .
nikon 4300 , i feel , is the best camera out there for the features and price .
the pictures are absolutely amazing - the camera captures the minutest of details .
the possibilities with auto , manual , and the very helpful " scene " mode , which offers 11 optimized situational settings like portrait , landscape , beach / snow , sunset etc . , are endless .
the movie mode is also working great .
the 4300 comes with excellent easy to install software i use it on xp and win98 without problem , battery charger , usb and video cable .
i experimented with online print ordering with the two major us brick and mortar retailers , and they both delivered great results .
even at the " normal " setting , a 8x10 print ! . shows not a single sign of visible rendering or pixels - you could never tell that the picture has been taken by a " digital " .
the battery life is ok , but can be somewhat short when working a lot with the monitor on .
over all a fantastic very compact camera , which made us experience photography on a totally new level ! .
after nearly 800 pictures i have found that this nikon takes incredible pictures .
the digital zoom takes as good of pictures , as the optical zoom does ! .
i love all of the features , and presets as well .
sunset feature takes incredible pics in the morning , and the evening ! .
the software you get with this camera is perfect .
touch ups , redeye , and so on are very easy to alter , and correct .
battery life is good , although i recommend two rechargeable , or a alkaline backup , for those emergency pics you have to have .
all and all , i am extremely pleased with this camera .
great camera , great investment ! .
the nikon coolpix 4300 is wonderful -- easy to use , high quality , and compact in size .
the auto setting does a great job most of the time but there are manual settings for those who want them .
it has many great features and very few bad ones .
it takes excellent pics and is very easy to use , if you read the manual .
downloads are a snap and quick .
controls easy yo use and easy to get to .
i 'm extremely glad i bought this camera .
really happy with this little camera .
it is n 't big and offensive , though you would n 't know it by looking at the pics it takes .
settings for just about everything , beautiful pics and beautiful prints .
i expected the 12x digital zoom to be grainy , but on full size high to fine quality , the zoomed images are quite impressive .
still , at least from my perspective , a great camera for the money , and i 'm a happy camper ! .
this is a wonderful camera .
4 mp gives you room for the future gaining experience ; . cost offsets over time from wanting more in a camera , 3x optical and the fact that it carries nikon 's quality reputation behind it make the whole package prove itself worth wile at the price .
one neat thing - i have taken some pictures in what i thought would be impossible lighting conditions pitch black rooms - no problem for the camera - rooms looked like they had ample lighting .
this little camera has created a marriage between myself and nikon . never knew i could love a digital camera so much .
the software that comes with it is amazing and the online service that comes free is really very neat . clean clear and well focused on over 95 % of all photos taken by a beginner .
just point and shoot and the photos were great .
the memory card fit nicely since i also have a pocket pc and it automatically installed a picture software on my pda willa .
if you have to buy a camera on a bu get , this has got to be the one .
great camera , i have been using this for several months and got excellent results , simple friendly usage , in many scenes indoor , outdoor , snow , close up macro etc .
this is my first digital camera and i can say that i am quite impressed with the features that it has .
it is easy enough to use for a beginner like me but it has plenty of features for me to grow into .
i particularly like the way it aids me in taking my macro shots .
my friends were impressed with the quality of the pictures i took ! .
battery life is ok .
great camera , and for the price you can 't beat it .
i found the controls very intuitive and learned how to maneuver through the menus quickly .
the quality is superb .
the small size is perfect for my little hands , but may perhaps be uncomfortable or awkward for a bigger person .
the 4300 is a very durable , compact package , and i find nikon to be a brand that i can trust .
it really is an awesome camera that is hard to beat for general-to moderate snapping .
they take excellent macro shots as well .
the menus and features are easy to manipulate and access , and it takes silent movies .
i compared this to a lot of other cameras , believe me , it 's value for money .
the picture rs are amazing .
recently bought this coolpix 4300 along with a 256mb ultra flash card . as expected , i happily found that qualities of the picture are excellent with 3m-4m pixel / fine combos and many of the user-friendly functions are very similar to slr models , and with added convenience of a digital camera that you can see pictures immediately .
i particularly like the " txt " file which records all the control information for all the pictures you take .
the compact digital camera is especially useful if you have little children around and you can always take the camera with you and take many pictures of them .
a nikon will make you happier and leave you lots of good memories , as always .
i highly recommend this camera to anyone looking for a good digital camera that takes great pictures yet does n 't take weeks to figure out how to operate .
we take this camera with us everywhere and are constantly amazed at the quality of the pictures that we get and the number of different ways the camera allows for pictures to be taken .
i am a picture fanatic so i consider myself picky and if your the same way this camera will not let you down . now buy it ! .
i have it for a week now , and this camera has exceeded my expectations .
the daylight pictures are brilliant and the indoor shots are very good provided that your subject is no more than about 8 feet away .
uploading the images to my windows-based pc is very fast and simple .
in summary , i love this camera and would whole-heartedly recommend this to anyone wanting a high quality point and shoot camera in the medium price range .
great camera .
i am impressed with how easy this camera is to use .
it takes great pictures .
the manual is easy to understand , and it is mostly idiot proof .
it is small , unlike my canon slr , so it easily fits in my pocket .
i got this camera about a month ago and i can 't put it down .
i selected the 4300 right away and have gotten high quality pictures every time .
autofocus feels exactly like my film camera while scene and manual mode add a little fun challenge to it all .
i have not been disappointed with my purchase .
picture quality in outdoor settings is indistinguishable from 35mm .
i am extremely satisfied with this camera .
the " scene " mode works well for the remainder of shots that are not going to be in a " regular " setting .
however , its 3x optical setting is acceptable for 70 % of the shots that i take .
if you 're looking for a small , compact , super resolution digital camera , you can end your search with the nikon 4300 ! .
after a lengthy and extensive journey for a feature-loaded , high performance , travel size camera , i initially gravitated to this little gem because of the superior picture quality 4 mega pixel .
after using it for about a month , i can state unequivocally that this nikon definitely delivers a huge bang for the buck .
its easy to use and the sheer fun of being able to use an array of nikon accessories like the telephoto and wide-angle lenses is the proverbial icing on the cake .
yes , the picture quality and features which are too numerous to mention are unmatched for any camera in this price range .
the design and construction are excellent -- as is the legendary quality of the nikon optics .
there are so many functions in this little , yet powerful camera ! .
seriously ! . i love it ! .
but this camera is great ! .
the picture quality is amazing and you can connect it to your tv and could make silent movies that way if you wanted to .
it does have a lense cap , but it wo n 't let you take pics with it on which is real good .
the battery recharges raul fast and the recharger thingy that comes with is real nice .
ooh , and i dropped it and it still works fine : this little camera has so many features i have n 't even gotten to all of them yet .
it 's easy for beginners to use , but has features that more serious photographers will love , so it 's an excellent camera to grow into .
it 's light weight enough to take with you everywhere , but powerful enough to get outstanding pix .
i love the continuous shot mode , which allows you to take up to 16 pix in rapid succession -- great for action shots .
i 'm amazed at the photo quality -- prints are indistinguishable from 35mm prints .
1 it has all the features an amatuer photo-enthusiast would want .
2 it is easy enough for my grandmother to use .
3 it is very compact but the controls are so well designed that they 're still easy to use .
6 the nikon coolpix line is a well-established line so you know support and parts are going to be available even when nikon releases a newer model .
7 picture quality is excellent .
8 battery life is excellent .
9 3x built-in optical zoom is a lot for this price range .
10 great price for all the features .
this camera was affordable , very easy to learn , and produces spectacular images .
the auto-mode is good enough for most shots but the 4300 also boasts 12 versatile scene modes as well as a manual mode though i admit i have n 't played with it too much on manual .
it 's size also makes it ideal for travel .
overall the nikon 4300 is a very dependable , robust , and useful little camera .
awesome camera with huge print quality in a tiny package .
the same 4mp chip from the 4500 camera , plus a 3x zoom with the ability to expand upon that with extenders , great closeup mode , long lasting rechargable battery , etc etc .
in my opinion it 's the best camera for the money if you 're looking for something that 's easy to use , small good for travel , and provides excellent , sharp images .
i 've had this beauty for nearly 2 months now and i truely love it .
it has it all .
this is the first phone i know of that has the large bright screen , infrared , bluetooth , usb connector and a speakerphone .
if you are looking for an upgrade , this is definitely the phone for you .
3660 had similar features , but that is big in size .
6600 looks and feels nice .
this one is full of features ( has bluetooth ) .
especially the lcd is big and the camera quality is among the very best around .
i have set up it 's pda features with avaunt . com where you can download info from sites like weather , map quest maps/directions into it , which is great .
using supplied s/w , you can transfer all addresses from a different nokia phone into it .
goes ~3 days after a charge .
i must add to the dismay/delight of readers this phone is simply the most groundbreaking phone mankind has ever held .
it has raised the bar owing to number of features it offers and the absolute ease of use delight .
1 . the phone has the best keypad any nokia phone has to offer .
believe me when i say this i have used and fingered all nokia phones and the 6600 has the best keypad
i must admit its not the best looking phone ever but then it has this look of static and absolute conviction that looks like everything a phone should be
3 . the nokia 6600 has a brilliant java interface .
the phone offers a 32 mb mmc card and i think that is certainly the most exciting feature .
capacity is not a problem here .
4 . the build is just right .
the phone is sturdy .
i 've dropped it at least a dozen times to my recollection and it still works as good as ever .
its a tough one this unless you wanna drive your car over it .
this isn 't the most rugged phone ever but then your not gonna play airplane with this , are you .
5 . the camera installed on this phone is awesome .
i click pictures in jog format and because the phone has a bluetooth device i find it extremely easy to transfer pics to my pc and forth .
the display and brightness on this phone is quite extraordinary .
the use of 65536 ( 16bit ) colors ensures you get your share of animations and icons on your phone
it has great incredibility .
the log functions helps you track down the incoming , outgoing calls in the most easy of ways .
the handsfree provided by the phone is useful for those who talk on the phone while driving .
this makes for a great phone .
since then , i have not found one major problem with it .
i highly recommend it if you are looking for a phone with great camera quality and/or lots of features you would find in a pda .
i own this phone for about 6 months now , i have used the following features : bluetooth connection to laptop and desktop for sync contacts and calendars with outlook , transfer files ( movies , songs ) , i have many movies on it now with a 512mb memory card that it takes .
handsfree future is good , but not too exciting .
this one has a good looking .
it 's oval and . . . nice .
i like it 's shape and it 's keypad and joystick .
it 's easy to use . not too small , and not too big .
the screen is quite big ( between all hand phone ) , but the just about 65000 color .
few month ago , it 's very popular among my community .
it 's good .
: ! . ok , score 7 . 0 oh yes , the newest color of this phone is quite cool .
while this phone obviously doesn 't have the same quality construction as motorola does , the nokia 6600 is one of the better phones i 've used .
what makes it so great is the versatility and the number of features it has .
1 ) great audio quality overall .
handset quality is great , as is the speakerphone quality and the headset audio quality .
a decent camera phone for taking quick pictures , movies , and having general all around fun with .
3 ) the joystick design they are using on the new nokias gives you a great degree of control .
4 ) one nice thing about nokias is that they have a ton of ring tone and game choices .
if you love your cell phone games or changing your ring tones everyday , nokia beats everyone else .
5 ) bluetooth wireless technology , so that i can transfer data to and from my computer without messing with any cables .
6 ) the phone is really wide , which seems to be a turnoff for many people , but the phone is actually easier to grip and feel more ergonomic .
i feel much less likely to drop this phone than others , which are actually starting to get too small .
i can tell using the phone that it feels a little flimsier than motorola's do , but as long as i 'm not planning on dropping the phone or running over it with my car it should be just fine .
other than that it meets or surpasses all of my needs and surely won 't disappoint any already established nokia phone fans .
applications : it has lots of applications and they work very well . . . when you eventually find where they are and they finally open .
the 6600 has more amenities than most - world phone , camera ( vga/zoom/night mode/timer ) , video ( w/ audio & zoom ) , speaker ( good sound ) , bluetooth , infrared , modem for computers , electronic wallet , internet access , calendar , calculator , converter and more .
dependability : i 've seen no glitches .
i 've had no problems w/ this phone .
although it has chubby hips , the device isn 't really so big .
solid , squeak-free , large screen .
memory/storage - seemingly boundless .
first of all , the phone houses a great deal of memory for multiple videos , sound clips , photos , texts , etc .
secondly , all info can be sent to a computer and w/o the hassle of usb wires .
the 6600 ( t-mobile ) is the true 'world phone ' in that it has the mhz to operate around the globe , including new zealand and australia ( 900 ) whereas the 6620 ( available from singular ) replaces it w/ 800mhz ( some refer to as 850 ) .
the latter will provide better coverage in more remote areas of the states but still operates in many countries , excluding new zealand and australia .
as the 6600 uses 900mhz , it operates in more countries than the 6620 .
the battery life is less than stellar , but it charges w/ the quickness .
remember , this phone uses an operating system - symbian . . . and it 's feature-rich w/ 65k colors .
it films 10 second video , for crying out loud .
there are number of downloads needed/available for this phone & they will be text ed to you at no cost .
a sony erickson may be the phone for you . . . but good luck finding one w/ all the features & such a competitive price .
despite a critical start , this phone deserves four stars because it accomplishes what it sets out to do ( which is pretty lofty ) . . . does more than most . . . does it well . . . is dependable .
this phone is one of the best i 've ever used .
it has everything i needed : bluetooth , infrared , support for mmc , camera , and a good operating system with lots of supporting software .
i would have given this phone 5 stars if it wasn 't for the fact that i would rather use my 3330 to do all the most common things you do with a phone .
the plusses are the features , look , good signal and battery life , memory size and robustness .
the camera and video functionality is decent , i can 't see myself wasting my time with it , but some people will .
this is a great phone i have this phone since feb 04 and i never have any problem at all .
very cool features . . . great camera with zoom . . . cool quality pictures . . . great ringtones . . . bluetooth feature is great . . . .
this thing does everything but washes your dishes .
i can use it as a modem for my computer , connect with clients and friends , the possibilities are endless .
the ringtones are beautiful , the screen is super high quality .
i do not need to repeat what 's great about this phone .
i never had a single problem .
it is nokia and thus easy to access the menu options .
high quality video and pictures rock ! .
3 band and you can just change the sim card in it to be able to use it in europe with another service provider .
bottom line great phone for the time being .
i use a nokia 6600 , it has a great color tft display and camera equipped with zoom , which complement a built-in video recorder with audio and a real one player for playback and streaming of 3gpp-compatible and real media video clips .
multimedia functions are enhanced by multi-slide mms messages and a gallery for organizing digital content captured or downloaded with the phone .
the nokia 6600 is a decent extension of the smart phone line .
the phone has such advantages as the excellent keypad and display , long rundown time and a good software suite .
in short , the nokia 6600 is an evolution but not a revolution .
i 'm sure you can read the specs above to see everything it does , but for me the best thing is that i can easily check my email , movie times , news , or any website with this phone .
you can take pic of your friends and the picture will pop up when they call .
give each friend a different ringtone .
get great themes and wallpapers for this phone and many many polyphonic rings .
a huge beautiful color screen which can not been scratched at all even with the rough handling i give it .
nokia makes great phones , and this one is the cream of the crop .
best phone i 've ever owned , period .
frankly , i think this is one of the niftiest pieces of hardware i 've ever used .
it is slow to initially start up , but once it 's turned on , i 've never had any complaints about the speed .
everything , so far , has worked flawlessly .
all at the same time , and all without a hitch .
i think the interface is great .
i actually purchased two phones recently ( this one at the new blackberry phone ) , and this one is far superior ( imho ) .
i love the features , the interface , the size ( the screen is a delight ) , the camera ( though i admit i 'm not much of a camera user -- so just a toy for me ) , the internet connectivity , the quality , etc .
if i had to do it over , i wouldn 't buy anything else .
upside : this one , like most nokias , receives a consistently strong signal ( i 've tried some samsung and sony ericsson models which were very weak on the reception front ) .
i love the bluetooth ; . easy to use with a wireless abra headset .
photos are pretty darned good ! .
probably a great phone overall , and perhaps mine just has bugs .
with one of the most intuitive user-interfaces around , seamless bluetooth sync with microsoft outlook , support for thousands of applications for the symbian platform which this phone runs on ( i own the ir remote , iq and a few others ) , the nokia 6600 is all of the above - one of the few phones from t-mobile that can claim such a distinction .
ive had this phone for a year now - and its the best phone i have owned .
this may be a really cool phone , but it 's not worth it with t-mobile .
this phone is fantastic .
great reception , visibility and interface ( may be complicated by others ) .
i highly recommend this phone .
i had a sony ericsson t610 before this and the t610 is far inferior .
im able to keep my phone on for about a week ( mostly stand by ) to three days ( regular use )
but this by far is the best phone out there right now ! .
i have a hard time using other phones with smaller screens ! . ! . ! .
the pics can be touched up in photoshop , and be printed at 4x6 and they look great ! .
i also use the phone as my modem via bluetooth to my apple power book ! .
the speed is the same as dali up , where i live we do not have wifi everywhere so this is my version of it until we catch up .
the phone itself is pretty nice .
camera quality isn 't bad for the low resolution .
this phone has a nice blend of features without going overboard .
i was looking for a phone which synced with mac osx using bluetooth , had decent battery life , could check email , had good reception , nice screen size and was durable ( i break often break small gadgets )
the interface is simple to use .
i have a couple hundred contacts and the menu loads within a few seconds , no big deal .
i did notice if you turn the phone on and off the os takes a bit to load up and initially the menus are slower but once the phone has been on and booted up the menus are reasonably quicker .
the camera is adequate and if i want high-res photos i 'll use my digital camera instead .
on the t-mobile service i was able to take pics as we drove across i-70 and email them to family & friends once we reached a t-mobile tone ( usually a major city ) .
outside of the t-mobile service area the phone seamlessly jumped onto at&t wireless and various other services where the t-mobile service was unavailable .
as i drove across the country i lost reception only in eastern kentucky 's mountains .
along the way we compared it to my wife 's t720i and the 6600 was superior in terms of battery life , connectivity bars and features .
for those mac osx users out there , isync works fairly well .
and bluetooth does not drain the battery as quick as i thought it would , i usually can go 1 . 5 days with bluetooth on along with making calls before i need a full recharge .
with bluetooth off the phone last almost twice as long .
the nokia 6600 is a great phone , good games , good camera .
the voice recorders good , but you can 't record songs off the radio for ring tones .
the games are decent , but u only get 2 to start off with .
but you can download some really good ones like pac-man or mafia wars .
overall the phones fantastic , and i would have given it 5 stars , but its not perfect .
the battery on mine lasts 2 days if i don 't play games that much , and it only takes 90 mins to charge from flat .
this phone has the best battery , it lasts longer then my old 3210
i got a 1gb mmc upgrade for this phone and now i can :
1 . record around 1 hour of video with phillips camcorder pro .
2 . take around 10 , 000 640x480 pictures .
3 . play java games on it .
4 . play n-gage games on it .
5 . check traffic411 . com for la traffic on the 405 .
6 . play game boy color games on it with go boy .
7 . have a good chunk of my small mp3 to listen through the speaker phone .
8 . connected the phone to my tablet pc and now can access company von at 56k speed via bluetooth .
clear the call logs once in a while to speed up the phone people ! . ! . ! .
as for bluetooth , no problems at all .
i 've connected the phone with two laptops and a ipa 4155 .
very simple and painless .
this is the first cell phone i 've owned , and overall , i am quite pleased with it .
among my requirements for a phone were : good screen , decent camera , bluetooth , and gprs support .
the 6600 was the best phone i could find with these options that i could get with t-mobile .
one primary reason for getting a cell phone was so that i could use it as an internet connection for my laptop running linux , where soft modem drivers are hard to find , and don 't work very well .
if you are using linux , and you want to use gprs to connect to the net , i suggest this phone along with a belkin usb bluetooth adapter .
i have really enjoyed the camera on this phone .
and the phone has a very cool feature which allows you to send images via a normal pop3/smtp e-mail account .
i will also say that setting up the e-mail account was very simple and straight-forward , although you do need an external smut server to use .
the phone can use any midi audio file as a ringtone .
which is really nice because you can get pretty much any piece of music in midi format for free on the net .
you can use the ob ex file transfer service with bluetooth from linux ( kde-bluetooth provides a nice integration into conqueror for this ) for sending files to the phone .
the fact that you can assign ringtones to people and/or groups is really cool .
i really dislike holding a phone to my ear , and i 've found the free speak to be very comfortable and easy to use with this phone .
but if you use all bluetooth accessories , as i do , its really not an issue .
all in all , this is a great phone .
especially for the price amazon gives it at ( i was unable to get mine through amazon due to some credit complications ) .
if you use linux and want gr ps and/or want to use a handsfree bluetooth device , and want a decent camera -- this is the phone for you .
i really love this phone . . .
you actually can talk to a real person for support in under an hour ! . ) .
have had the nokia 6600 for a year now and am generally very happy with it and with t-mobile .
it offers way more features than i need but the ones i use work well .
i almost always get a good strong signal , even in fairly remote areas here in the southwest .
the sound quality is excellent and the speaker phone couldn 't be easier to use .
i like the size and shape .
it fits comfortably in my hand and pocket .
it also works just fine for international calls .
it 's a bit pricey to call home from other countries but the instant messaging to and from covered countries in europe are quite reasonable .
it 's really well made and has survived sliding across floors and pavement without a scratch .
i 've had nothing but good luck with t-mobile .
their customer service agents are always prompt and polite and my service is terrific .
i never get dropped calls .
i recommend t-mobile and the nokia 6600 without reservation .
the nokia 660 runs the symbian os , which works pretty well for most standard phone fare , most of the stuff is not that intuitive , but if you actually learn how to use it all , there 's plenty of neat tie-ins .
i 've had this phone for almost a year now and it has been nothing but great to use .
i can connect to my computer via bluetooth to transfer images , calender events , contacts and anything else .
another great feature for me anyway is the ability to load . wav sounds as ringers .
this way i never have to be ripped off by the carrier for stupid ringtones , i can get whatever i want .
other than that , the simian series 60 os is great and offers lots of proprietary software that will work on your phone if you 're willing to hunt for it .
initially these phones were fun to play with some of the cool features like the speaker phone , web browser and of course the built in camera .
the good : 1 ) large lcd screen , colorful display , good resolution .
2 ) nice features , like web browser , camera , video recorder , speaker phone ( very usefully ) , clear voice reception .
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .
3 ) joy stick for eazy navigation , 35mb memory card to store the pictures and stuff .
the bottom line is " phone is cool one - only for the moment , as its the latest phone in the market and has all the new features , but this will soon be displaced by upcoming newer phones " .
if you are looking for a phone to integrate as easily as the sonyericsson phones with isync , i say stick with a sonyericsson .
it is a multifunction phone , reception quality is better than the 610 .
speaker phone quality is good , and poping in a 512mb mmc card , it rocks ! .
putting in mp3 player , lots of games and application to download .
i got this phone yesterday and didn 't find any problems with it yet .
picture and video quality is ok .
love the speaker phone .
incredible memory ! .
aside from a 6mb++ built-in phone memory , there 's a 32mb mmc card that goes with it ! .
picture quality 's great for still and video with sound .
you can record your voice and turn it into a ringtone .
n6600 supports midi , wav , arm , mp3 etc .
it has a handsfree loudspeaker , conference and transfer ! .
i love this phone .
this phone is one of the milestones in the history of the cellular phones .
supporting an operating system , symbian os , you can download and run a lot of programs on this phone .
you can turn this phone into a gaming machine , a camcorder or a digital camera , an mp3-player , a movie viewer , a voice recorder , a personal secretary , a gaps map browser , a book , a multifunction remote controller , practically everything that you can do with the computer , plus it is a phone ( ! . ! . ) and also you can carry it in your pocket : ) .
many of these programs are shareware , some can be purchased by paying a little bit of bucks .
it uses the extend able mmc memory , it is perfect for storing videos , pictures and mp3s .
its nice look is also a plus .
and also , since it is teri band and since it uses sim-card , you can just use it in europe and many other parts of the world , wherever gsm exists .
i am just in love with this phone , especially after using a more primitive phone about 3 years .
there is much which has been said in other reviews about the features of this phone , it is a great phone , mine worked without any problems right out of the box .
i have had the phone for 1 week , the signal quality has been great in the detroit area ( suburbs ) and in my recent road trip between detroit and northern kentucky ( cincinnati ) i experienced perfect signal and reception along i-75 , far superior to at &#38 ; . t 's which does not work along several long stretches on that same route .
my favorite features , although there are many , are the speaker phone , the radio and the infrared .
the speaker phone is very functional and i use it in the car , very audible even with freeway noise .
the infrared is a blessing if you have a previous nokia and want to transfer your old phone book to this phone , saved me hours of re-entering my numbers .
here 's the brief synopsis : the phone is tiny , cute , feels kind of " plastic-like " ( as if it might break ) , but seems pretty sturdy .
it has lots of little cute features , my favorite being the games and the pim ( personal information manager -- i . e . organizer ) , and the radio ! .
on the up-side , the phone has amazing battery life .
i do like this phone overall ( would give it a 3 . 5 ) , but unfortunately , i am returning it .
in all fairness , customer reps are very nice , and they ( most of them ) try hard to answer your questions .
t-mobile is trying very hard , and again -- they do have pretty good csr 's .
i 'm staying with sprint , and though i fear that their csr is n 't nearly as good as t-mobile 's , the clarity of their reception is exceptional .
while i like the performance of the phone in every regard , i would buy another one solely upon the apparent indestructibility of it .
i highly recommend a nokia 6610 .
no other color phone has the combination of features that the 6610 offers .
from the speakerphone that can be used up to 15 feet away with clarity , to the downloadable poly-graphic meg atones that adds a personal touch to this nifty phone .
whether you 're taking a brisk jog , waiting for a bus or just having lunch at the park , you 'll be glad you had the fm radio .
i treat the battery well and it has lasted .
overall this has been my favorite phone that i have owned .
it has a nice color screen .
it is small .
t-mobile was a pretty good server .
while i had the phone , the positive features were : good sound quality and an excellent fm phone and earpiece .
the two biggest things is the excellent working speakerphone " unlike the nokia 3650 " and the superb reception nokia is known for in the gsm phones they make . . .
this phone is a winner . . .
anything this phone does , it does perfectly .
the speakerphone , the radio , all features work perfectly .
this phone has a very cool and useful feature -- the speakerphone .
as said before this works perfectly .
you can adjust the volume to be heard anywhere or so that it does n 't make that big of a disturbance .
the person on the other end of the call can hear you perfectly .
you can be up to about 3 feet away from it and it will still work perfectly .
this phone is one of the few phones that have an fm radio tuner built in .
this radio receives fairly decent reception but not nearly as good as a normal radio , but as long as the stations are coming in clearly the phone 's radio should work perfectly .
i bought this phone for my trip to south africa and it worked almost perfectly .
anywhere i went in south africa this phone received full bar reception .
another benefit of this phone is that it is truly an international phone ; . the 6610 is sold in almost everywhere in the world .
this means that there is a good chance that this phone will not break easily like typical american phones .
when you put this phone in your pocket you forget it is there ; . it is unbelievably small and oh , so light .
this is a benefit for many reasons ; . one being just for appearance , your pants wo n 't be bulging with this phone in your pocket .
the battery life on this phone is surreal .
i 've used the speakerphone for almost two hours once and the battery did not even go down one single bar .
it is amazing that the battery lasts so long when the phone is so small and light .
this phone has many other features , ir , ; . just to name one , the features above i view as the most beneficial .
overall , i highly recommend this phone .
it is a perfect phone in such a small and appealing package .
size - extremely small and convenient will fit in your pocket and not bother you .
sound - excellent polyphonic ringing tones are very nice ( check cons ) it also doubles as a radio , which is a nice feature when you are bored .
speakerphone - loud and clear has some nice extra features like currency converter and a stopwatch .
surfing the web on it is nice as well , i just wish there were more wap pages available .
nice little phone . . . light compact . .
although the nokia 6610 is a little short on the features department , it is an outstanding piece of hardware for doing what it was primarily meant to do : to be a wireless telephone .
the reception and sound quality are top-notch .
i like the size and weight of this little critter .
i am able to carry it close to my body , in places where other phones are not so easily concealed .
the screen is bright , easy to see in the daylight , with nice colors .
it receives very nice mms pictures from other gsm phones .
but , then again , the ringer can be so loud that i heard it ringing inside my office , when i was already out on the street . . .
- light , compact design
- solid , high-quality construction
- well-backlit keypad
- outstanding signal reception
- excellent sound quality
- bright , visible screen
- speakerphone
- very long-lasting battery life
one of the best cell phones i have ever used to-date .
i like the speak phone function a lot .
i am very pleased with its quality and durability .
i like the automatic key lock function .
the phone is very light weight .
the screen is bright and ring tones are unlimited .
the fm radio is cool .
while going for a cellphone , i was fully determined to buy a nokia only as it is the best in cellphones .
and really this is the best phone one could have .
it has all the features one would need in a cellphone .
it is lightweight , sleek and attractive .
this phone is very user-friendly , easy to manipulate &#38 ; . very convenient to scroll in menu etc .
it has fm radio option and i can listen to music anytime .
its speakerphone option allows us to do long talks conveniently , lying on bed &#38 ; . phone lying by your pillow side .
it comes equipped with lot of wallpapers and polyphonic sweet tunes .
i am enjoying my phone a lot . . . .
small size .
i love the fact i can carry it in my shirt or pants pocket and forget about it .
color screen is good .
it has lots of features such as the calendar which works like my outlook calendar .
the keys are laid out normal so there is no guessing .
navigating through the menus is super easy , especially if you have owned a previous model nokia phone .
battery life is very good , i use it every day and i have to charge it every 5 or 6 days or so .
nokias have always had good sound quality and this is no exception .
the loud speaker function on the 6610 is great because you do n 't need to put your phone right next to your ear to talk .
i like my phones to be small so i can fit it in my pockets .
overall this is a slightly better than average phone .
this is the best phone i have seen .
the phones are awesome .
we hardly ever have to charge them , get great reception ( live in chicago ) , and the customization and applications are awesome .
you can do * so * much more with the pc suite , i . e . free ringtones from midi files , free graphics from any picture on your computer , and if you know how to program jame you can even make your own apps / games .
the phone 's sound quality is great ( turn up the volume if its too quiet , people , this thing will get loud ) i dont have any complaints about this phone and the only thing that i miss from my 8290 is voice dialing .
i bought this slick phone and i am very happy with it .
nice and small and excellent when it comes to downloading games , graphics and ringtones from www . crazy cellphone . com
i just purchased this phone and i think this is the coolest phone i ever had .
the features are really cool like the radio .
the first night i got this phone i put it next to me when i went to bed just to listen to my favorite music station and the handset itself doesnt weight anything its too light and feel so comfy with it .
technology wise , i think this is awesome plus the speaker makes it even great ! . ! . ! . ! . i love this phone ! . ! . ! .
for a specific location , i still think its a great phone .
this really is a great little phone ; . its got nice features , a beatiful screen , great ergonomics , and its tiny ! .
this phone won me over , and a big seller was the size ; . it fits nicely into any pocket without falling out .
nokia was my first non flip phone , and i 'm glad i decided to go with them .
first of all , my calls were loud and clear , unlike with sprint .
i could make phone calls from locations i previously could not ( like my apartment ) .
the phone is small , light , and very attractive .
the battery life is amazing .
the color screen is a plus , as are the polyphonic ringtones .
i 'm not one who uses web browsing , so this phone easily met and surpassed my needs .
i highly recommend this phone to anyone .
it is a great phone , if you are traveling all over the world , packed with wonderful features .
this is a very light phone - a little less than 3 oz , with long battery life ( not as long as the new polymer technology ) .
the hands-free speakerphone is quite powerful ( like the motorola phone , i used to own ) .
i simply love this feature .
in addition it comes with a sleek and powerful headset .
the built in fm radio is excellent for people traveling by public transport .
the pc sync feature is superb that comes with nokia pc suite software ( with data cable or infrared port or bluetooth ) .
additionally , it has more fun stuff like more tones , wallpapers , screen saver , stop clock , alarm , java applications ( chess , currency converter etc . )
the mobile text messaging , chat , picture sharing etc . other niceties , that you would enjoy .
the mms technology is very well integrated with this phone , which you will enjoy .
i can recommend this phone to anyone , anytime .
not only is it the perfect size ( not too small , not too large ) , it also has all the features a high-tech phone user would want .
in true nokia style , the phone is simple to use and despite its delicate appearance , this little guy is as durable as other nokias i have owned .
the phone book is very user-friendly and the speakerphone is excellent .
even better , with the optional headset you can listen to music over the integrated radio .
however , the battery life is good enough you should n 't be overly concerned with turning this phone off .
overall this is the best phone i have ever owned .
nokia does not disappoint in this model .
it has great battery life , fm radio , excellent signal , hands free speakerphone ( which i have to say is probably my favorite function ) and downloadable java apps .
great phone . . .
great features . . .
i did a ton of research and settled on this phone because of the small size , speakerphone option , great priced calling plan and access to my corporate email .
i have had no problems with the phone .
great phone , i 'd buy another .
excellent phone , the phone looks much better than what u see in the pictures .
overall an excellent phone .
the service from t-mobile is very good too .
great phone , easy to use , excellent network , no regrets ! . ! . ! .
i purchased this phone for just 50 $ and there is no end to what i can do with it .
nokia and t-mobile really teamed up well on this baby .
service is great as far as i can tell , features work like a charm , ringtones are high quality if you buy them from t-mobile and aim is great .
this is probably your best bet if you are looking for a phone in this price range , or like me , do not have the patience to deal with annoying flip phones .
1 month , no problems , great phone i 'm very pleased with my 6610 phone .
yes , the features are numerous .
the speakerphone works better than any speakerphone i 've ever had .
the sound quality is excellent , except , maybe a * tad * too quiet at times when there are quieter talkers on the other end of the line .
the included earpiece is very comfortable and easy to use .
i have not had any distortion problems with this phone and am more pleased with this phone than any i 've used before .
first let me say that it is much smaller than it looks on the web and it also looks better .
the radio feature has superb sound quality .
it has a classic design yet looks hip .
it is extremely light and disappears in your pocket .
the battery is alot better than most of the phones out there .
this phone is great as a whole and is not like others with one or two good qualities .
it does well in all aspects of internet browsing .
battery life is good for a phone of this size .
but anyway , the only thing you should really look at here is the fact that the phone does have voice dialing .
great screen and great sound .
the 6610 excels as a cell phone , thank god .
the voice quality is very good , and it gets great reception ( that is , in places where you get t-mobile coverage , which is not that good ; . see below ) .
the color screen makes this free-after-rebates phone shine bright , and commands are very responsive .
other than that , this is a perfect phone for those of us with no patience for flips .
the nokia 6610 is a relatively new phone , and what a great phone it is .
after using it , i found the size to be perfect for carrying in a pocket .
it is just a tad small to hold to your ear with your shoulder , but that is solved with the very comfortable handsfree ear-piece which is included .
when i turned the phone on , the first thing that hit me is how good the screen is .
the resolution is very good and the colors are bright and even changeable ! .
the ringtones included are awesome , and did i mention they were polyphonic ? .
you can also assign special rings and graphics to special people when they call .
the phone also sports an image gallery ( with option camera attachment ) , a calendar / organizer , alarm clock with snooze , fm radio ( way cool , even if it is just through an ear-peice ) , games , java applications and gprs high-speed internet connection .
all my questions or problems have been quickly and satisfactorily resolved .
the rate plans are also very good , at least for me .
this phone is highly recommended otherwise .
nokia makes a great phone , that 's clear .
with all its complicated features , the menus are easily accessible and the quality of the features is great .
this phone is good with a huge array of features built into it .
the design is sleek and the color screen has good resolution .
it is very light weight and has a good signal strength .
but , i would definately recommend this phone .
it is crystal clear .
this is one of the nicest phones nokia has made .
sound quality : the ipod 's sound quality is pretty good .
the bass is deep and the treble is clear .
ease of use/design : the ipod is a very easy to use mp3 player , and if you can 't figure this out , you shouldn 't even own one .
the ipod is a fine cousin to the early macs and current offerings from jobs and company .
long live apple , long live macs , and long live the ipod ! .
i have an ipod and it is a great buy .
very sturdy and strong .
the software with the ipod includes itunes , which allows you to play the music on your computer , rip cds onto your computer , and move your music from the computer to the ipod .
this new click wheel ipod allows you to navigate through the menus and song via a touch-wheel for scrolling and click-able buttons for selection .
the song quality of the ipod is excellent , and the included ear buds are actually more than satisfactory , for most users .
battery life keeps improving on the ipod , and a new ipod will give you up to twelve hours of play time , per charge .
thank you apple ! . you make fabulous products .
the product i rate five stars ,
plus , if you order from amazon . com , they will exchange it for you no problem .
this one has a color display , which i like a lot , being very visual .
i loaded a lot of photos into it and they display very clearly for such a small screen and , very importantly , the transition from one photo to the next is instantaneous .
the sound is just fine .
it comes with an adapter to plug into the wall , which i hear is a step up from the other ipods , which require you plug it into a computer to charge it .
pros : large hard drive for the $$ -- 20gb and 40gb are both affordable .
decently sized screen -- one of the larger ones on the market at 2 "
decent battery -- on the average size , but the 40gb comes with a dock .
firewire & usb2 . 0 -- for those fortunate enough to have firewire400 , your in for a real treat with auto sync .
great design -- very sleek and touch wheel has still never been successfully copied ( virtual ones are the only competition ) ; . and now the wheel clicks , taking away a lot of headaches from 3rd gen and very navigable in the menus .
good sound -- plays very nicely , even though the stock headphones are kind of weak durable -- not the most durable because its mostly plastic , but very compact and sturdy
games -- not really important , but exist ant
hold button -- suprisingly not all mp3s have this ; . this allows you to have all the buttons unusable , so that you don 't accidently hit something in your pocket .
. itunes -- this is a love-hate relationship program ; . usually people with mac like this program than people with a pc , but depending on your computer expertise , this could be a difficult program to use , and it is required for an ipod .
comments : overall this is still a great value , but is kind of overrated in the sense that there are beater deals on the market .
versatile and stylish .
i had a casio unit , which had given great service , and would have been happy to get another one , but was tempted by the ipod 's sleek design , storage capacity , connection options- - firewire and usb , and its integration with itunes .
the controls and the menus are clearly displayed and easily fathomed
the ipod is a very nice product , which given reasonable care , should give a lot of service .
i have about 6 gb used on my ipod so far ( well over 1000 songs ) , and as far as i can tell , all of them play at near-cd quality .
other than the fact that one can 't delete a file directly from the ipod , the interface is excellent and mind-numbingly simple to use .
as for itunes , i don 't find it to be as good as the windows media player as a computer mp3 player , but it is good enough .
in conclusion , i gave the ipod a 4/5 because anything this expensive should would work just about flawlessly .
everything i wanted ! . the apple ipod has become one of the most sought-after electronic gadgets - and for good reason .
its sleek design , large memory capacity , compatibility with itunes , and ease of use makes this one of the best portable digital listening devices on the market .
unless you have an enormous music/audio book library , the 20 gb model should have more than adequate storage capacity , with a stated ability to hold 5000 songs .
features : click wheel to navigate ; . ability to work with windows or mac ; . optional back lighting ( you can have it on all the time , or have it shut off to save battery power after 5 , 10 , or 20 seconds ) ; . ability to download pda info ; . automatic or manual download from itunes when ipod is plugged into your computer .
there 's even an equalizer ( under " settings " ) that allows you to adjust the sound for acoustic , bass booster , bass reducer , classical , dance , " deep " , and electronic .
with accessories , you can make the ipod into a digital recorder , broadcast it remotely through stereo speakers using wireless technology , and play it through your car speakers using either a cd adaptor or fm stereo broadcaster .
itunes can be downloaded from the enclosed cd or for free from the apple site .
all in all , this is a wonderful device .
apple has definately fulfilled its reputation in making quality equipment , and surprisingly wasn 't as expensive as its reputation normally holds .
battery non-issue .
finally , compare the ipod to other players on a cost/gb , and also consider ease of use .
the ipod is not overpriced compared to the market .
this is the best purchase i 've made in a very long time .
the sound is incredible ; . very clean , very wide dynamic range of bass , midas and highs , and can be very loud if i turn it up full blast .
the great and versatile ipod
the sound quality is excellent , accessing the music is easy , and the controls are generally well thought out .
i still give the ipod five stars , though , as it could have been something i did incorrectly during the install ( though i did follow the onscreen prompts ) so i 'll give apple the benefit of the doubt .
the battery holds a charge for a very long time ( maybe 15 or so hours of use ) so realistically there are no real range or endurance issues associated with ipod use .
( it sure does look nice , though ! . ) i recommend this to any music lover anywhere : the quality of the audio is excellent , the controls and indicators rapidly become intuitive , and the storage capacity and battery life are huge ! .
using the software itunes is relatively simple , you just plug the usb cable in , wait your machine to detect the ipod and voila , any songs listed in your itunes library will be transfer ed on over to the ipod .
and , with the ipods ' full volume up , all you have to do is adjust your receivers ' volume and your set , since the ipod itself acts as a strong amp lifer of its ' own .
however after purchasing a 20 gb ipod it 's clear to see the superiority .
for a sleeker , smaller and more " average " mp3 player the nitrus is great but the ipod blows it out of the water - the interface is great and the design is wonderful .
the actual experience of using the ipod is magnificent .
the design , as mentioned above , is sleek , cool and trendy ( and i think trendy = good , but it 's always hard to tell these days ) .
the battery life last es 12 hours , and charges quickly . ( as mentioned above , the initial charge is a minimum of only two hours - not too long at all ! . ) once you 've downloaded your music , you can access the tracks by artist , genre , album , composer ( this comes in handy when the actual composer is different from the artist - e . g . covers of songs ) , etc .
the ! . sound quality is great .
the included earphones are pretty good - my advice ? .
the ease of use of the ipod is a major attribute .
with the ipod , you can also store documents and contact files ( from programs such as microsoft outlook ) when it 's connected to your pc as an external hard drive .
also included in the " games " section is the great music trivia option - which tests your skill at being able to quickly place your own songs .
20 gb or 40 gb ? . the pros of the 40 gb : comes with a " dock station " and double storage space ( 10 , 000 songs ) .
overall the ipod really is an almost flawless beast . the capacity in the 20 gb is more than i think most people would ever need and , for the price , i highly recommend it .
everything else about the ipod is great , the click wheel is very easy to use and so is the software that comes with it .
finding all the albums , songs etc is much easier than you would think it would be even if you have 20 gig ( well 18 gig ) worth of music .
it all sounds great too .
you can even use the ipod to store files from your pc and export your outlook files to it .

so reliability is the winner here for the ipod .
for looks , well ipod is head and shoulders better , both the iriver and creative zen look positively ugly when next to a gleaming ipod .
the ipod package comes with everything you need , the ac adaptor , firewire cable ( quicker than usb , but slower than usb 2 which it also gives ) , those snazzy and power full headphones , and of course the player .
these issues aside , the ipod is kind of like the cell phone in that once you have one , you can 't be without one .
also , you have to use it with itunes - or they 'll sue , dammit ! . but itunes is about as good as anything .
the player is great .
overall , this product is awesome .
all the " cool " features of the mini , but with 20gb instead of 5 .
really easy to use .
has the click wheel and the ability to scan through thousands of songs and organizes them great .
has a great helpline .
they fix the problem and help you with whatever your i-pod needs comes with two usb ports and a charger .
they are extremely convent and you don 't have to buy them seperately has i-tunes , which provides quality music at low prices .
the i-pod is the best thing i have ever used .
i found that to be the most impressive thing about the ipod 'mini ' - basically for ease of use , and the feel it gives .
this unit comes with the usb/firewire cable as a standard item now .
i have transferred in about 2 , 400 tracks so far - very easy to use both the ipod and itunes .
i was worried about what the sound quality would be like , but that seems to be just as good as the actual cd sound .
i love the features on the ipod and the many things you can do with it .
the arm band is fantastic and it doesn 't budge even at the gym .
i love the slim design ; . the weight would only be an issue if it were bulky .
the ear buds that come with it look cheap , but the sound quality is amazing .
the click wheel is incredibly convenient , however it can be a little overly touchy at times , which will make you frustrated with your own fingers .
i am a big fan of itunes , simply because it is terribly fast and convenient - if you are buying the songs from the itunes site .
way to go apple ! .
i rarely get drawn in by mass-commercialism , but something about the ipod made me say , in the words of lou and andy , " i want that one ! . " i was willing to shell out
it can not be the computer or the owner , since i purchased mcgee anti-virus 8 and it installs and works fine with no problems .
nis 2003 worked like a charm last year .
anti-spam is good
the latest of internet security has antispam function that is helpful because i has received a mountain of those these days .
but that is good for me because symantec soft wares are a bit hard to master for me who are not savvy on computers .
i 'm not sure why all the bad reviews , my computer isn 't especially slowed down and i have win '98 .
sure , it slows it down a little , but that 's expected .
perhaps semantic could work out the efficiency a little , but these reviews are highly exaggerated . . . i would ask what else these people are running on their computers ( ? . )
this is the fourth version of systemworks and the second version of internet security that i have used and it has always been a favorite .
the antivirus feature is phenomenal , and is regularly updated .
i think their antivirus software was one of , if not the best , on the
once installed , however , some of the functions do work ok ( disk doctor , one button checkup , and win doctor ) .
these tasks are faster and easier than in prior versions , and i found the menu to be much more navigable .
their website had a download that helped remove those , although i had to manually remove a good number of files from the " programs " directory .
norton 's memory usage on systems with 512 mb is very low .
i just got an older 866 mhz system with 512 pc 133 ram and it also runs fine on that .
both the antivirus and firewall are integrated into one piece of software and they update together .
you won 't need to update your firewall and antivirus separately or install two disks .
the best part of the firewall is the visual backtracking .
we were able to obtain a norton corporate edition of antivirus only ( no firewall or utilities ) and so far it 's great .
i 've used the corporate edition at work without any problems ever .
by the way , i use the norton 2003 corporate at work with absolutely no trouble .
likewise , i 've heard norton 2004 professional version is fine too .
i 've been using nis 2004 for about 2 months and it works well .
norton pops up a window about the intrusions and gives me as much detail as possible about where the intrusion is coming from .
the pop up blocker and anti-spam are bonuses .
i didn 't have any major problems installing this software .
anyhow , this software is working fine and no problems since i installed it two weeks ago .
mine installed no problem ( but i did uninstall my norton anti-virus 2002 & personal firewall 2002 first ) .
seems to work great .
this did manage to cut the number of pop ups during start-up from 4 down to 2 .
while it didn 't have all the features i would have liked , it was better than anything else i could find at the time .
also , with one click you can help train your spam killer .
and the firewall came with a wizard which made it effortless to configure it to my lan .
it 's a highly rated , kick ass firewall program that 's bundled with the venerable norton antivirus , plus extras ( like norton antispam & norton parental control ) that make this security suite a must-have for people who have broadband internet access .
luckily , with 3 rebates this product will cost me nothing ! . it is indeed worth nothing .
i 've tried the free versions of zone alarm and the free version of skate and they both have a nice and easy installation and work great ! . .
the only free help you get is in renewing your subscription ! .
the product has worked perfectly for me on my xp .
no more banner ads , pop-ups , and the reliable antivirus .
i work on word , explorer , netscape , acrobat reader , photoshop at same time ( meaning using a lot of memory ) , but still dont see a problem with computer ( getting slow or crashing ) .
this product is way cooler than anything ive used before ( pencilings and maccabees and norton antivirus alone ) .
5 stars all the way ! .
all in all it hasn 't been a bad product .
i 've owned many norton products in my time , and for the most part , i 've been pleased with their performance .
this is also the case with nis 2004 .
i upgraded from nis 2003 , and the change in performance has not been noticeable .
on the contrary , i 'm quite pleased with my upgrade .
it works better and has more useful features than nis 2003 .
the program is fully featured , with much of what you 'd want from a security program --
the installation , set-up , and operating interfaces are well organized and intuitive and the email spam component works well .
pi ii 1ghz 512mb rd ram windows xp pro 80gb hd i was able to uninstall nis 2003 and install nis 2004 with no trouble .
i installed , activated and registered nis 2004 without issue .
so far , the anti-spam feature seems to be very good .
i downloaded a trial version of computer associates ex firewall and antivirus and fell in love with a computer security system all over again .
i did not have any of the installation problems that people highlighted here .
their products have been great and have saved my bacon on numerous occasions .
